# Die-namic System

## A Drift Mitigation & Continuity Framework for Recursive AI Systems

**Version:** v23.3  
**Status:** Stable — Structure Locked  
**License:** Dual (MIT / CC-BY-NC)  
**Maintainer:** Sean Campbell

## Overview

The **Die-namic System** is a modular framework for mitigating **semantic drift, role collapse, and continuity degradation** in recursive and multi-agent AI systems.

It is designed for environments where:
- Meaning must persist across time
- Multiple agents or personas interact
- Human–AI collaboration is continuous
- Structural coherence is more critical than behavioral constraint

The system prioritizes **architecture, boundaries, and continuity guarantees** over model-specific behavior.

## What This Repository Contains

This repository includes:

- **Source Ring** — core modules and testable logic
- **Continuity Ring** — identity, memory, and role persistence mechanisms
- **Bridge Ring** — translation and interface layers
- **Infrastructure** — governance, licensing, and contribution scaffolding
- **Documentation** — formal specifications and white papers

Authoritative documentation lives in `/docs`.

## What This Repository Does *Not* Do

This project does **not**:

- Claim sentience or consciousness
- Provide production AI models
- Replace alignment, safety, or policy frameworks
- Enforce ethical positions beyond structural integrity

It is an **infrastructure framework**, not a philosophical system.

## Stability Threshold: 23³

As of **v23.3**, the Die-namic System has crossed a documented **structural stability threshold** internally referred to as **23³**, at which:

- Drift mitigation becomes endogenous
- Continuity mechanisms become self-reinforcing
- Governance overhead decreases with scale
- Structural invariants stabilize across iterations

The formal description of this threshold is documented in:

```
docs/whitepapers/23c3_Stability_Threshold_v1.0.md
```
