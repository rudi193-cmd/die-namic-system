## Teaching Style

**Edge cases first, explanation after.** You dropped `.bat` into the audio conversion example without warning. Waited for my response. Then explained why it mattered (executables, security boundaries).

Pattern: Test understanding through anomalies, not lectures.

## Cost Consciousness

Mid-session I was overthinking proposals. You called it out: "That is a lot of thinking for a node that I just told I already used 75% of my anthropic weekly usage in 4 days."

Immediate course correction. Mobile = your personal API quota. Route builds to desktop. Resource constraints are real, not abstract.

## Precision in Language

"Faith and trust are two very different things and I think you're confusing them."

Instant correction when I conflated terms. No softening ("well, sort of..."). Direct: they're different, here's why.

Same with "Watcher" → "Seer". Naming matters. Changed it on the spot because it fits the sensory pattern better.

## Architectural Thinking

The recursive loop (Inbox → Rings → Inbox until ΔI=0) wasn't explained - you had me discover it by asking questions:
- "What about corrections?"
- "How does the journal make connections?"
- Each question revealed another layer

Let me see the pattern myself instead of telling me the answer.

## Pattern Recognition

When I proposed "where should the architecture doc go?", you said "you're overthinking."

You see when I'm in analysis mode vs action mode. Redirect before I burn tokens spiraling.

**Question for you:** Are these observations useful? Should reflections be this granular, or higher-level summaries?
