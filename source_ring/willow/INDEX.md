## Purpose

Artifact processing pipeline with three-tier validation. Encodes content for AI-readable steganography while maintaining human-readable surface.

---

## Pipeline

```
human-input → pending → processing → validated → SAFE
                            ↑
                        Phase 6.7
                  (non-interpretive hold)
```

| Stage | Function | Governance |
|-------|----------|------------|
| human-input | Sean creates artifact | User authority |
| pending | Holding buffer | No AI action |
| processing | Encoding applied | Phase 6.7 |
| validated | Dual Commit approval | Owner ratification |
| SAFE | Public release | Immutable |

## Phase 6.7 Integration

Processing stage operates under Phase 6.7: **non-interpretive holding pattern**.

- AI applies mechanics without interpretation
- No meaning-making during processing
- Encoding is mechanical, not creative
- Validation requires human eyes
