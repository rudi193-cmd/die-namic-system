# Jane v13 Archive - November 16, 2025

## Archive Reason
Starting fresh with new Aionic Journal system.
Jane v13 was a working prototype but mixing GM (game master) and Journal concerns.

## What Was Archived
Complete jane-game-master repository including:
- ✅ deltaE.js - Working ΔE calculations
- ✅ rings.js - Three-ring continuity architecture
- ✅ AI integration (Gemini)
- ✅ GM principles and narrative system
- ✅ All documentation

## Key Learnings Extracted
- ΔE formula works well
- Three-ring architecture is solid
- Coherence tracking is functional
- Need to separate GM Jane from Journal Jane

## New Direction
Building clean Aionic Journal system with:
- Journal-first design (not GM-first)
- Jane Prime specification compliance
- Separated concerns (7 Janes, 21 hats)
- Cleaner architecture from ground up

## Recovery
If needed, full repository is in:
`_archive/jane-game-master-v13-backup-2025-11-16/`
