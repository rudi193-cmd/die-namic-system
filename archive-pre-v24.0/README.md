## What Happened

Version 24.0.0 represents a fundamental shift in the Die-namic System governance model.

**Before (v23.x):**
- Governance by ring isolation
- Decision Classes (I, II, III)
- Structure-lock as stability mechanism
- Large governance documents

**After (v24.0):**
- Governance by delta + human ratification
- 2d6 model (Delta + Human = Law)
- Smallness as stability mechanism
- Exit must be smaller than system

## Why Archived (Not Deleted)

These documents explain how the system operated from v23.3 through v23.x. They are historically significant:

- They show the evolution of thinking
- They document what was tried
- They honor the work that led to inversion

The framework inverted. The history remains.
