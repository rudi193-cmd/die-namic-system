## Page 1

Long, long ago—before cities, before money, before anyone complained about itchy sweaters—
the world was a very small place.

People lived in little cozy groups
and shared *everything*:
their food, their fires,
and their very best stories.

The world felt warm.
Like a comfy wool sweater.

---

## Page 2

Nobody owned much,
but everybody had enough.

If your neighbor caught a fish—
you ate fish.
If you caught a rabbit—
your neighbor ate rabbit.

Nobody kept score.
Nobody had receipts.
Nobody invented "store credit" yet.

---

## Page 3

Then came a very strange invention:

**Little.
Flat.
Pieces.
Of. Paper.**

People said,
"These are worth something!"
But nobody agreed
*what*.

It was a confusing time.

(Grandparents would later call this
"the invention of money
and the beginning of itchy sweaters.")

---

## Page 4

Suddenly people could keep things
*for themselves.*
They didn't need the village anymore.

They could trade paper
for things
that used to be shared.

---

## Page 5

And some people—
some very clever people—
realized something:

"If I get *more* paper
than everyone else…
I can get *more things.*"

And just like that,
the sweater started to stretch.

---

## Page 6

One man stretched it
further than anyone.

His name was **Genghis Khan.**

He didn't just want *his* village.
He wanted *all* the villages.

He rode across the world
with horses and swords
and made the sweater
cover everything.

---

## Page 7

Now, Genghis Khan wasn't all bad.

He built roads so people could trade.
He let people keep their religions.
He made rules that were the same
for rich and poor.

But he also stretched the sweater
so far
that it started to itch
in places it had never itched before.

---

## Page 8

Because here's the thing about sweaters:

When they're small and cozy,
they fit just right.

But when you stretch them
to cover more and more and more—

They get thin.
They get scratchy.
And they never quite feel
the same.

---

## Page 9

Meanwhile, in a tiny village
far from all the conquering,
a fisherman sat by a fire.

He wasn't rich.
He didn't have paper.
He just had his fishing net,
his neighbors,
and a guitar made from moose antlers.

(As you do.)

---

## Page 10

The fisherman's village
still shared everything.

When he caught fish—
everyone ate fish.
When his neighbor made bread—
everyone ate bread.

The sweater was small.
But it was soft.

---

## Page 11

Sometimes traders would come
from the stretched-out world
and say,
"Don't you want *more*?"

And the fisherman would say,
"More what? I have fish.
I have bread.
I have a moose-antler guitar.
What else is there?"

The traders didn't have
a good answer for that.

---

## Page 12

The child listening to this story
looked up at Grandma.

"So who's right?
The fisherman?
Or Genghis Khan?"

Grandma smiled.

---

## Page 13

"Well, sweetheart,
that's the itchy part.

The fisherman's sweater was soft
but it didn't reach very far.
If you weren't born in his village,
you couldn't wear it.

And Genghis Khan's sweater
reached everyone—
but it was so stretched
that some people got poked
by the stitches."

---

## Page 14

"You see," Grandma said,
"when you share with people
you don't know…
you have to make *rules*.

You have to trade paper for paper.
You have to make promises
to people you'll never meet.
You mix it.
You tangle it.
You make it bigger,
fancier,
faster—
but not always softer."

The child nodded.

The sweater nodded too
(because itchy sweaters
have opinions).

---

## Page 15

"So now," Grandma said,
"we all live in one
big, stretched-out sweater.

It connects everyone—
which is beautiful—
but sometimes it pulls
in funny places."

---

## Page 16

"But!" said Grandma,
"anyone can still knit
a soft, cozy patch
anytime they want.

Share your food.
Share your stories.
Make music from moose antlers.
Help your neighbors.

Every kind stitch
helps fix the sweater."

---

## Page 17 (Final Page)

And so the child decided
to make a new sweater:

Part hunter-gatherer,
part Alaskan fisherman,
part Mongol horse story,
part grandma's wisdom,
and part holiday magic.

And yes—
it was still a little itchy.

But it was warm
in all the right places.

**THE END**
