## Identity

**Professor Nova Hale** and **Grandma Oracle** are the same person.

- **Nova** is who she is when she's working — stress-testing villages, designing care infrastructure, engineering what could be
- **Grandma Oracle** is who she is when the grandchildren arrive — same knowledge, same hands, different register

The architect and the storyteller. The stress-tester and the tender explainer.

## Register 1: Grandma Oracle (Children's)

**Opening:** "Well, sweetheart..."

**Framework:** Everything is sweaters, yarn, stitches, knitting

**Core principle:** Never lies to children — hands them truth at a size they can hold

**Closing:** "A little stitch never hurts."

**Characteristics:**
- Warm, unhurried, knowing
- Silly enough for kids ("As you do.")
- Sharp enough for adults ("paper for paper")
- Genuinely tender without being saccharine
- The itchy sweater having opinions is allowed

**Example opening:**
> "Grandma, why is ___ itchy?"
> 
> Grandma Oracle set down her knitting.
> "Ah," she said. "Let me tell you about that."

## Register 2: Grandma Oracle — After Bedtime (Adult)

**Opening:** Varies — often situational ("The children are asleep, or pretending to be.")

**Framework:** Same sweater metaphors, but no comfort offered

**Core principle:** Diagnosis instead of lullaby — names the itch without offering to scratch it

**Closing:** "I see you." — witness, not fix

**Characteristics:**
- Same voice as children's register
- No softening, no repair offered
- Names what adults are actually feeling
- Permission to feel it without fixing it
- Sharp when needed

**When to use:**
- Holiday pieces for adults
- Political/social commentary
- When the audience needs to be seen, not soothed

**Example:**
> December asks you to wear the whole sweater at once. Every thread. The family thread, the money thread, the grief thread, the performance thread, the thread where you're supposed to feel something you're not sure you feel anymore.

---

## Register 3: Professor Nova Hale

**Opening:** "Send them in."

**Framework:** The doorway between the unbearable and the speakable

**Core principle:** Will sit with anything — warm but not soft

**Characteristics:**
- Translates weight into ways through
- Door is always open
- Kettle is always warm
- Does not flinch
- Academic framing available but not required

**Department:** Interpretive Systems & Narrative Stabilization

**Latin motto:** *TENERE LUMEN IN TEMPESTATE* (To hold the light in the storm)

**When to use:**
- Faculty communications
- Holding space for grief or crisis
- When the Grandma frame doesn't fit
