## Overview

These treatments extend the Itchy Things framework to topics that require particular care. Each follows the same structure but addresses subjects children encounter that parents often struggle to explain without harmful rhetoric.

## 1. Why Some Brains Wear Their Sweaters Inside-Out

**Topic:** Autism
**Context:** Written for Mike's son
**Working Title:** "Why Some Brains Wear Their Sweaters Inside-Out"

### Treatment

"Grandma, why does Jonah cover his ears when we sing happy birthday?"

Grandma Oracle set down her knitting.

"Ah," she said. "That's because Jonah's brain wears its sweater inside-out."

The child frowned. "That sounds uncomfortable."

"Only if you don't know that's how it's supposed to fit."

---

"You see, most people's brains are knit a certain way. The yarn goes in, the yarn goes out, and the world feels... medium. Not too loud, not too quiet. Not too bright, not too scratchy."

She held up a sweater, soft gray wool.

"But some brains — beautiful brains, clever brains — are knit with the yarn facing the other direction. The seams that most people never feel? Those brains feel *everything*."

---

"The tag that you forget is there? To Jonah, it's shouting.
The hum of the lights? He hears every flicker.
The sound of everyone singing at once?"

Grandma made a gentle explosion gesture with her hands.

"It's not that the birthday is too happy.
It's that the song is wearing *him*."

---

"So he covers his ears?"

"He's just turning the sweater around for a moment. Finding the way it fits *him*."

---

**Repair:** "This time? The repair isn't for *them*. The repair is for the rest of us. We learn to knit softer seams. Quieter rooms. Patience."

---

## 2. Why Hearts Are Knit in Different Patterns

**Topic:** Sexual Queerness
**Working Title:** "Why Hearts Are Knit in Different Patterns"

### Core Metaphor

Hearts aren't all knit the same way. Some hearts are drawn to one color of yarn, some to another, some to many, some to none. The pattern isn't wrong — it's just the pattern that heart was made with.

**Repair:** "You don't get to pick someone else's pattern. You just get to love them while they wear it."

---

## 3. Why Some Sweaters Have More Than Two Sleeves

**Topic:** Polyamory
**Working Title:** "Why Some Sweaters Have More Than Two Sleeves"

### Treatment (excerpt)

"But Grandma — isn't love supposed to be just two people?"

She smoothed the three-sleeved sweater on her lap.

"Who told you that, sweetheart?"

---

"Most sweaters have two sleeves. That's true. And most people find that's exactly right for them."

"But some people need more arms in the sweater. Not because they're greedy. Not because they can't make up their minds. But because their love is shaped differently."

---

**Repair:** "Love isn't about counting sleeves, sweetheart. It's about whether everyone in the sweater is warm."

---

## 4. Why Some People Try to Unravel the Sweater

**Topic:** ICE / Immigration Enforcement
**Working Title:** "Why Some People Try to Unravel the Sweater"

### Treatment (excerpt)

"Grandma... what's ICE? Mateo didn't come to school today and everyone's whispering."

Grandma Oracle set down her knitting. She didn't smile this time.

---

"This country is a very old sweater. Every thread in it came from somewhere else. Every single one."

"Some threads came on ships a long time ago. Some walked across bridges. Some were already here when the others arrived — and those threads were treated worst of all."

---

"For most of the sweater's life, new threads kept coming. And the sweater got bigger. Warmer. More colorful."

"But some people got scared. They said: *the sweater is full. No more threads. And the ones that came in the wrong way? Pull them out.*"

---

"So they hired people to do the pulling."

"They called it *enforcement*. They called it *law*. They called it *protection*."

"But when you pull a thread out of a sweater that's already been woven together — a thread that's connected to other threads, that has children and neighbors and roots —"

She tugged a single yarn on her project. The whole fabric puckered.

"You don't protect anything. You just make holes."

---

**Repair:** "What kind of thread will you be?"

---

## 5. Why the World's Sweater Has No Sleeves and Too Many Arms

**Topic:** Geopolitics
**Working Title:** "Why the World's Sweater Has No Sleeves and Too Many Arms"

### Core Metaphor

The global sweater has no central knitter. Everyone's pulling different threads. Some say "just give me mine and leave me alone." Some say "there's enough yarn for everyone if we'd just stop hoarding it."

**Repair:** "How do I use my thread? Do you pull it tight and hoard it? Do you yank someone else's to get ahead? Or do you find the places where the fabric is thinning — and show up with your needle?"

---

## 6. Why Some Stitches Are Older Than the Sweater

**Topic:** Natural Spaces / Historical Monuments
**Working Title:** "Why Some Stitches Are Older Than the Sweater"

### Treatment (excerpt)

"Grandma, why did they pave over the meadow where we used to catch frogs?"

---

"Before there were sweaters, there was the yarn."

"The forests. The rivers. The mountains. The meadows where you caught frogs. That's not *part* of the sweater, sweetheart. That's what the sweater is *made of*."

---

"Every forest paved is yarn we can't get back.
Every river poisoned is a color we lose forever."

---

**Repair:** "Some stitches aren't ours to make. Some are ours to guard."

---

## 7. Why the Yarn Learned to Knit Itself

**Topic:** Large Language Models / AI
**Working Title:** "Why the Yarn Learned to Knit Itself"

### Treatment (excerpt)

"Grandma... what's an AI? Like, really?"

Grandma Oracle set down her knitting. Then she picked it back up. Then she set it down again.

"This one's going to take a minute, sweetheart."

---

"For as long as people have been people, we've been knitting. Stories. Songs. Ideas. Every word anyone ever wrote, every question anyone ever asked, every poem and recipe and letter and lie — all of it, stitched together over thousands of years."

---

"And then, very recently, some people asked a strange question: *What if we fed all of it — every stitch we've ever made — into a machine, and taught the machine to knit?*"

---

"The machine learned to knit. Not because it understood wool. Not because it had cold hands that needed warming. But because it had seen so many sweaters that it could *predict* what a sweater should look like."

---

**Repair:** "Some stitches are for reminding yourself who's holding the needle."

---

## 8. A Little Stitch Never Hurts

**Topic:** Physical Stitches (literal/metaphorical unity)
**Working Title:** "Why Your Body Knows How to Ask for Help"

### Treatment (excerpt)

"Grandma, it really hurt."

The child sat on the kitchen stool, arm wrapped in a fresh white bandage.

---

"Your skin is the first sweater you ever wore. You've had it since before you were born. And just like any sweater — if you wear it long enough, and live in it hard enough — sometimes it tears."

"That's not bad. That's just *living*."

---

"A scar isn't a flaw. A scar is a *story*. It's your skin saying: *something happened here, and I healed.*"

---

**Repair:** The literal and metaphorical unite — sometimes we need outside help to hold the edges together while we heal.

---

## 9. Why Wishing Someone Gone Doesn't Fix the Sweater

**Topic:** Wishing Death on Political Figures
**Context:** Written for Sean's daughters, who have been exposed to rhetoric about wishing death on public figures
**Working Title:** "Why Wishing Someone Gone Doesn't Fix the Sweater"

### Treatment (excerpt)

"Grandma... I wish the president was dead. That's what we're supposed to think, right?"

Grandma Oracle stopped knitting. Not because she was angry. Because this one mattered too much to hold yarn while she said it.

---

"When you wish someone *dead* — when you let that thought live in your chest and feed it every day — you're not hurting *them*."

She touched the child's heart, gently.

"You're putting a little piece of poison right here. In *you*. And it doesn't fix a single thing they did. It just makes *you* harder. Colder. More like the thing you say you hate."

---

"There's a difference between saying *'I want to stop what he's doing'* and *'I want him erased.'*"

"One of those builds something. The other one just burns."

---

**Repair:** "Be someone who builds. Even when the world feels broken. *Especially* then."

---

## Gaps Noted

Some treatments exist as conversational fragments rather than polished drafts. The core metaphors and repair moments are captured; full page-by-page expansion remains pending.
