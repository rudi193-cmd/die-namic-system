## Measurement Philosophy

Success is measured through shares and engagement quality rather than raw view counts. The work is built to *land*, not to go viral. One person at the right moment reading a piece and finally having words for what they couldn't explain — that's the win.

"Tools don't thank you. They just get picked up."

## December 2025 Deployment

### Grandma Oracle Posts (Prose)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Views | 100-150 per post |
| Shares | 3-5 per post |
| Downvotes | 0 |
| Comments | 0 |

**Analysis:** Clean, no friction. Picked up and carried without argument. Landed complete — people agree, nothing to add.

### The Ungentle Blessing (Poem)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Views | ~300 |

**Analysis:** Hit different. Raw, edges showing, no frame. Permission with teeth. The poem was a flare; the Oracle posts are candles. Both light. Different reach.

### Reply Comments

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Views | 50+ each |

**Analysis:** The replies are leverage. The posts are seeds; the replies are where conversation happens.

---

## Pattern Observed

Posts = seeds (quiet, clean, carried without comment)
Replies = leverage (50+ views minimum, conversation entry points)
Poems = flares (higher reach, different audience)

---

## What "Working" Looks Like

- Shares without downvotes = the people who find it agree
- No comments = landed complete, nothing to add
- Shares > likes = being carried forward, not just consumed
- Reply engagement = entering existing conversations effectively
