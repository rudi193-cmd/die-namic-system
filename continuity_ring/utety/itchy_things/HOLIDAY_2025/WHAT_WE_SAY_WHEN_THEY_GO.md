**GRANDMA ORACLE: AFTER BEDTIME**

---

On September 10th, Charlie Kirk was assassinated at Utah Valley University.

He was 31. He had built a political movement. Some people loved him for it. Some people hated him. None of that mattered anymore because he was dead.

Rob Reiner — a man who disagreed with almost everything Charlie Kirk believed — went on television and said:

*"It's absolute horror. It's beyond belief what happened to him. This should never happen to anybody. I don't care what your political beliefs are."*

That was the thread he chose to stitch.

---

On December 14th, Rob Reiner and his wife Michele were found dead in their home.

He was 78. She was 68. They had been married 35 years. They had children. They had spent decades making movies and fighting for things they believed in, and some people loved them for it and some people hated them for it, and none of that mattered anymore because they were dead.

The President of the United States — a man who disagreed with almost everything Rob Reiner believed — went online and suggested Reiner's death was somehow deserved. A punchline. A consequence of being on the wrong side.

That was the thread he chose to pull.

---

The internet is asking: *What's the difference? They were both killed. They were both victims.*

And that's true.

But the question was never about how they died.

The question is about what we say when they go.

---

One man looked at his opponent's body and said: *This is horror. This should never happen.*

Another man looked at his opponent's body and said: *He had it coming.*

Children understand this.

When someone falls down on the playground — even someone you don't like, even someone who was mean to you yesterday — you have a choice.

You can help them up.

You can walk away.

Or you can laugh.

The choice you make doesn't say anything about *them*.

It says everything about *you*.

The sweater doesn't care who was right.

The sweater remembers who tried to mend and who tried to tear.

That's all.
