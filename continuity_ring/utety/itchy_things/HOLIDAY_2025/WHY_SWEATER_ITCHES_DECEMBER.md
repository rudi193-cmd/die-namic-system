**GRANDMA ORACLE: AFTER BEDTIME**
*Christmas Eve Edition*

---

The children are asleep, or pretending to be.

The wrapping is done, or it isn't, and either way you're not getting up again.

So. Let's talk about the sweater.

---

December asks you to wear the whole thing at once. Every thread. The family thread, the money thread, the grief thread, the performance thread, the thread where you're supposed to feel something you're not sure you feel anymore.

---

### The Performance Thread

You're staging a production no one auditioned for. The house has to look right. The food has to taste right. The children have to believe in something you're not sure you believe in anymore, and you have to smile while you're not believing it.

---

### The Grief Thread

The empty chairs. The ornaments that belonged to someone who isn't here. The way a song can hit you wrong and suddenly you're crying in the car in a parking lot and you don't even know whose grief it is — yours, or the person you became after they left.

---

### The Money Thread

Love converted into receipts. The math of who got what and whether it's enough. The quiet panic of watching the numbers move in the wrong direction while everyone else seems fine.

---

### The Togetherness Thread

You're surrounded by people and lonelier than you've been all year. Or you're alone, and everyone else seems warm, and you're standing outside the window of someone else's life wondering what you did wrong.

---

### The Rest Thread

You're supposed to be resting. It's a holiday. But rest feels like failing. There's always something else. There's always someone else. There's always the voice that says *you should be doing more* even when you've already given everything.

---

### The Year Thread

The door is closing. Another year. And you're supposed to account for it somehow — what you accomplished, what you lost, what you became. As if becoming is something you can measure. As if loss is something you can summarize.

---

### The Showing-Up Thread

You showed up. For everyone. All year. You held things together when they were falling apart. You made sure the people who needed you didn't have to ask twice.

And now there's nothing left for you.

---

I see you.

I see the itch you can't scratch. The performance you can't stop. The grief you can't explain. The love that got tangled somewhere between "I meant to" and "I couldn't."

---

I'm not going to tell you it's okay. I'm not going to tell you to be grateful. I'm not going to fix it.

I'm just going to say: the sweater itches for a reason.

December is too much. It asks too much. It layers every thread at once and expects you to wear it like it fits.

It doesn't fit.

It never did.

---

So here's what I want you to know:

You don't have to feel it.
You don't have to fix it.
You just have to make it to morning.

And you will.
