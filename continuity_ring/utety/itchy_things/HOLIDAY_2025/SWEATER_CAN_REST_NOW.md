**GRANDMA ORACLE**
*Christmas Eve*

---

The house is quiet now.

Or quiet enough.

The children are asleep, or pretending to be, and either way they've stopped asking for things.

The wrapping is done, or it isn't, and either way you're not getting up again.

---

So.

Let the sweater rest.

---

You've been wearing it all month. Every thread pulled tight. The family thread. The money thread. The performance thread. The one where you're supposed to feel something you're not sure you feel anymore.

Tonight, you can set it down.

---

Not forever. Just for now.

Just for this hour, when the candles have burned low and the dishes can wait and nobody needs you to be anything but here.

---

I know the table wasn't perfect.

I know someone said something. Or didn't say something. Or looked at you a certain way that you're still carrying.

I know there's an empty chair.

I know.

---

But here's the thing about Christmas Eve:

It's the night where everyone's supposed to make room.

Room for the stranger. Room for the traveler. Room for the one who showed up without an invitation, without the right clothes, without anything to bring.

---

So make a little room for yourself.

For the version of you that didn't get everything done. For the version of you that snapped at someone, or cried in the car, or spent too much, or couldn't spend enough.

For the difficult one. For the stranger. For the version of yourself you haven't forgiven yet.

A little room. That's all.

---

So here's what I want you to do:

Nothing.

For just a few minutes, be a person in a chair, in a room, at the end of a long day, at the end of a long year.

You don't have to earn this rest. You don't have to deserve it.

You just have to take it.

---

The sweater can come off now.

Just for tonight. Just for this hour.

Let it rest on the chair. Let your shoulders drop. Let whatever you were holding... hold itself for a while.

---

Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

You made it.

---

## Production Notes

The tolerance threads carry the teachings of Christ in nondenominational, sweater-based form: room for the stranger, grace that doesn't require agreement, making space when there isn't space.

Paired with "Why the Whole Sweater Itches in December" — diagnosis, then permission.
