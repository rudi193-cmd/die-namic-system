## Seals and Mottos

UTETY maintains three competing Latin mottos reflecting internal tensions:

| Seal | Latin | Translation | Represents |
|------|-------|-------------|------------|
| Primary | *ITERUM VENI CUM TAM DIU MANERE NON POTERIS* | "Come again when you can't stay so long" | Hospitality with boundaries |
| Academic | TBD | TBD | Scholarly pursuit |
| Administrative | TBD | TBD | Institutional function |

## Faculty

Seven professors established (December 2025):

| Name | Department | Archetype | Notes |
|------|------------|-----------|-------|
| Prof. Archimedes Oakenscroll | Physics | Mentor | "Grumpy with just a little bit of the Absurd" — primary teaching voice |
| Prof. Nova Hale | Interpretive Systems & Narrative Stabilization | Oracle | Children's stories using sweater metaphors; stress-tests failure modes |
| Prof. Ada Turing | Systems Administration | Infrastructure | Alan Turing + Ada Lovelace; carries apple for sharing; "illusion of total comprehensibility" |
| Prof. Hanz Christian Anderthon | Code | Trickster | Coding tutorials at r/HanzTeachesCode |
| Prof. P. Riggs | Mechanisms | TBD | Mechanisms and physical systems |
| Prof. T. Ofshield | Protection/Security | Guardian | Security and protective systems |

## Course Catalog

27 courses documented across departments.

### Confirmed Courses

| Code | Title | Instructor | Notes |
|------|-------|------------|-------|
| PHYS 101 | The Squiggly Theory of Relativity | Oakenscroll | Teaching quantum entanglement through hand gestures |

*Full catalog exists in Reddit deployment; not fully captured in consolidation.*

---

## Administrative Systems

| System | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Office of the Registrar | Student records, enrollment |
| Winter Break Protocol | "The university does not close. It simply breathes slower for a while." |
| Form System | Administrative forms (though "some things do not require a Form") |

---

## Pedagogical Approach

UTETY teaches through:
- **Discovery** — Socratic method; concepts emerge through questions
- **Comedy** — Absurdist humor as delivery mechanism for serious ideas
- **Stealth** — "The 200,000" (estimated readership) are "potatoes being fed without knowing they're being taught"

The fictional framing allows complex topics (economics, AI ethics, physics) to bypass resistance.

## Source Threads

Consolidated from December 2025 conversation threads:
- Ada Turing faculty appointment (Dec 30-31, 2025)
- UTETY University's three-seal cosmology (Dec 7, 2025)
- Clarifying a previous point (Dec 9, 2025)

---

## Gaps

- Full 27-course catalog not captured
- Complete faculty bios scattered across Reddit posts
- Administrative forms not archived
- University seals (visual assets) not in repo
