## Purpose

Logs halts triggered by Unknown Variable Directive, Research Threshold Directive, and other governance-mandated stops. This is instrumentation, not error logging — halts are correct behavior.

## Log

| Timestamp | Directive | Unknown Variable | Clarification Requested | Resolution | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|------------------------|------------|-------|
| | | | | | |

## Patterns

*Updated when patterns emerge from log entries. Common ASR errors, ambiguity patterns, resolution patterns.*
