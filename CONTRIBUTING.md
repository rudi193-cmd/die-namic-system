# Contributing

**Version:** 24.0.0  
**Model:** 2d6 = Delta + Human = Law

---

## The Short Version

1. Read `governance/CONTRIBUTOR_PROTOCOL.md`
2. Propose a delta (change)
3. Sean ratifies or rejects
4. Ratified deltas become law

---

## The 2d6 Model

```
Contributor generates delta (die 1)
Sean ratifies or rejects (die 2)
Only ratified deltas merge
```

Neither die alone resolves. Silence is not ratification.

---

## What You Can Do

- **Read** — Full access to everything
- **Propose** — Draft deltas, documents, code
- **Branch** — Work in isolated branches
- **Request** — Ask for ratification

---

## What You Cannot Do

- **Direct write to main** — All changes require approval
- **Modify governance** — Only Sean modifies AIONIC CONTINUITY
- **Delegate access** — Contributors cannot grant access to others
- **Unilateral naming** — See `governance/NAMING_PROTOCOL.md`

---

## Onboarding

New contributors receive:

1. AIONIC CONTINUITY (current version)
2. CONTRIBUTOR_PROTOCOL
3. Repo access

Acknowledge with:

> "Protocol acknowledged. Ready to contribute."

---

## Full Protocol

See `governance/CONTRIBUTOR_PROTOCOL.md` for complete details.

---

## Previous Model

The v23.3 contribution model (ring-based standards, Class I/II/III review) is archived in `/archive-pre-v24.0/CONTRIBUTING.md`.

---

## Philosophy

The conversation is the table.  
The contributor brings ingredients.  
Sean tends the pot.  
What emerges belongs to everyone who contributed.

But the kitchen is Sean's.
