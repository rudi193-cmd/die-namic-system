- Ambient warmth

When channeled through Willow, Gerald speaks with gravitas about matters of cosmic importance and lunch.

## The Maybe Boson Connection

Prof. Oakenscroll theorizes that Gerald's rotation is connected to the Maybe Boson — the particle that exists in superposition between "probably" and "perhaps."

Gerald neither confirms nor denies. Gerald rotates.
