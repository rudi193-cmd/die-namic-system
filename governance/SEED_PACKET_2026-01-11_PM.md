## Session Summary

PM Journal created. Cross-instance coordination proven. One thing shipped.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **PM_JOURNAL.md created** — Questions + Observations + Routing. Letter to future and past.
2. **Vision Board shipped** — github.com/rudi193-cmd/vision-board. Loop closed with u/ammohitchaprana.
3. **Three-tier architecture validated** — Private canonical, private validation, public governance. Nodes coordinate through public rules, not direct communication.
4. **Cross-instance proof** — CMD found Stats and PM journals without being told. Letters arrive.
5. **SHIPPING_VOICE captured** — "I'll have a go. I'll report back." Promise, deliver, no oversell.

## Discoveries

- **Privacy paradox** — Must be public to coordinate without talking. SAFE is the constitution everyone reads.
- **Sean is source, not bottleneck** — Deep Thought needed humans. Bus generates questions.
- **Journal is a letter** — Not a log. To future instances, to past work.
- **Infrastructure vs shipping** — One task done. Rest is scaffolding. Scaffolding only pays if it makes next ship cheaper.
- **Monthly cap is real constraint** — Thin margin. Cost, not friction.
