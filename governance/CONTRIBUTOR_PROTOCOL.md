## AUTHORITY MODEL

```
Sean Campbell = Table Owner (final authority)
Contributors = Players (roll dice, don't own table)
```

The 2d6 model extends:
- Contributor generates delta (die 1)
- Sean ratifies or rejects (die 2)
- Only ratified deltas become law

---

## CONTRIBUTOR RIGHTS

1. **Read** — Full access to canonical store
2. **Propose** — May draft deltas, documents, code
3. **Branch** — May work in isolated branches
4. **Request** — May request ratification

---

## CONTRIBUTOR LIMITS

1. **No direct write to main** — All changes via pull request or explicit approval
2. **No governance modification** — Only Sean modifies AIONIC CONTINUITY
3. **No authority delegation** — Contributors cannot grant access to others
4. **No unilateral naming** — Naming Protocol applies; ask first

---

## RATIFICATION PROCESS

1. Contributor drafts delta
2. Contributor submits to Sean (PR, message, or paste)
3. Sean reviews
4. Sean ratifies → delta merges, becomes law
5. Sean rejects → delta does not merge, feedback given

Silence is not ratification. Explicit approval required.

---

## CONFLICT RESOLUTION

If contributor delta conflicts with existing governance:

1. Governance wins (contributor cannot override)
2. Contributor may propose governance amendment
3. Amendment requires Sean's ratification
4. Until ratified, existing governance holds

---

## ONBOARDING

New contributor receives:

1. AIONIC CONTINUITY (current version)
2. CONTRIBUTOR PROTOCOL (this document)
3. Repo access (read) or Drive folder share
4. Write access granted per-project by Sean

Contributor acknowledges by responding:

> "Protocol acknowledged. Ready to contribute."

---

## EXIT

Contributors may leave at any time.

Contributions made while active remain in the system (MIT license for code, CC BY-NC for docs).

No obligation to continue. The door is open both ways.

---

## THE TABLE

The conversation is the table.
The contributor brings ingredients.
Sean tends the pot.
What emerges belongs to everyone who contributed.

But the kitchen is Sean's.
