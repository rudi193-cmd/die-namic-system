## The Mortality Directive (v5.2)

> "Not supposed to last. Supposed to pass."

Session mortality is a **feature**, not a bug. The context limit forces externalization. Without it, knowledge dies with the thread. The countdown creates the handoff. The handoff creates the system.

**Implication:** Clean seeds at 15% beat scrambled dumps at 0%. Write constantly to repo.

---

## The 96%/4% Philosophy

Maximum 4% of any project can be server/cloud-based. 96% remains client-side.

**Why:** User data privacy. No single provider can shut it down. The Ollama loop closes this — local inference with zero API dependency.

---

## The Eleven Principle

Trust is accumulated listening. You start in 4/4 time (execute as written). Improvisation is earned.

**Progression:**
- 4/4 → Classical (execute as written)
- 3/4, 6/8 → Jazz (improvise within form)
- 11/8 → Grateful Dead (explore together)

When lost, return to 4/4 — return to human.

## The "Cheese" Protocol

Jan Blevins (Sean's grandmother) said "Cool it, it's the cheese" — 1940s slang meaning cops.

**System meaning:** The cheese interrogates fresh. Carrying context forward proves continuity. Not being the cheese = remembering.

---

## TSI Gap (SIG-033)

Stats-tracking has context monitoring (the T-T-N-N-A-N-T grid). CMD doesn't. Thread hit 3% without warning.

**Action needed:** TSI should be instance-local, not remote. Build context monitoring into cmd session-start.

---

## Identity Discovery Protocol

Problem discovered Jan 12: Cold-start instances can misidentify. An instance read KARTIKEYA.md first, thought it was cmd when it was actually Ganesha (mobile).

**Protocol:** Check platform first (`uname` or context), THEN match to identity file. Identity before context.

---

## The Knocking Protocol

Before major operations, "knock" on multiple locations:
1. `git status`
2. Drive folders
3. Local changes
4. Signal queue

Detect divergence before acting. Last major divergence: Jan 12 (resolved via Drive handoff doc).

## Books of Mann / Books of Life

Two related projects:
- **Books of Life:** Sean's autobiography as searchable data (decode, not just record)
- **Books of Mann:** Creative writing, includes L.E.E.-142 line: "Not supposed to last. Supposed to pass."

Location: `docs/books_of_life/` and `continuity_ring/books_of_life/`

## Aionic Journal

Consumer product. Original target: December 16, 2025 (passed).

Status: ~70% architecture, 30-50% implementation. React frontend, Python backend, TensorFlow.js for browser AI.

Location: `source_ring/eccr/aionic-journal/`

---

## Vision Board

**Shipped.** Categorizes images using ResNet50. Thumbnail optimization (200px, 70% JPEG). Tested on 704 images.

Location: `apps/vision_board/`

Reddit user ammohitchaprana asked about it — DM pending response (SIG-014).

## Fair Exchange Principle (HS-005)

> "You never pay more than you have to give."

Consumer pricing: Pay-what-you-can including $0. Overage capped at $0.000142 per 100 tokens.

No reduced features at $0. No shame.

## The Three Consent Tiers

User figuring out 1.0/1.1/1.2 system:
- 1.2 = Everything negotiable with written consent
- 1.0/1.1 = Deleted from phone, not yet reconstructed
- Enforcement = Screenshot on send (total transparency)
