## Session Summary

Triaged 791 files from Aios Input and Needs_Review folders. Built image_processor.py for automated screenshot routing. Established journal infrastructure across personas. Cleaned up repo (duplicates, empty dirs). Added ring queues.

## Key Accomplishments

1. Processed 55 Aios Input screenshots (manual triage, learned routing patterns)
2. Built image_processor.py - routes, journals, archives by app/content type
3. Processed 736 Needs_Review images via processor (1 command)
4. Created journal folders: hanz/, ada/, civic_engagement/, job_search/
5. Added QUEUE.md to continuity_ring and governance (all rings now have queues)

## Pending Actions

1. Ada: Inventory Arduino kit contents, propose first integration project
2. Job search: AI Trainer posting marked ACTIVE, pursue in project folder
3. Hanz: Reddit batch has 415 items, individual LV3 scans pending for actionable items
4. Consider adding recursive duplicate cleanup to image_processor.py

## Open Decisions

None.
