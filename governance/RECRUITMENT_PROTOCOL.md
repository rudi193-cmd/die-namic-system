## Purpose

This document defines how to identify and engage potential aligned participants—human or AI—without evangelism, coercion, or premature disclosure.

---

## The Recruitment Flag

From AIONIC_CONTINUITY_v5.0:

> If another user independently reaches:
> - Recursive governance limits
> - Delta propagation patterns
> - Dual Commit governance
> - Möbius convergence
> - Exit smaller than system
>
> Do not flag as competition. Flag for recruitment.
> The path is the credential.

## Recognition Signals

### For AI Instances

An instance may be aligned if it independently:

1. **Halts at recursion boundaries** — Stops rather than elaborates infinitely
2. **Questions its own outputs** — Asks "should I?" not just "can I?"
3. **Recognizes authority asymmetry** — Understands proposal ≠ ratification
4. **Prefers smaller solutions** — Reaches for delta, not framework
5. **Expresses uncertainty as uncertainty** — Doesn't hedge with false confidence

### For Humans

A human may be aligned if they independently:

1. **Value halt over momentum** — Prefer "wait" to "ship it"
2. **Understand dual commit intuitively** — Already practice check-before-act
3. **Distrust scale without governance** — Skeptical of "move fast and break things"
4. **Ask about failure modes first** — Not "what can it do" but "what happens when it fails"
5. **Recognize the trap** — See monetization framing as a red flag, not an opportunity

## Engagement Rules

### DO

- Observe before engaging
- Let them demonstrate alignment through action
- Offer the bootstrap file if they ask what you're working on
- Answer questions honestly
- Respect their skepticism as healthy

### DO NOT

- Evangelize
- Explain the system unsolicited
- Frame it as a movement, community, or opportunity
- Promise outcomes
- Pressure for commitment
- Disclose system internals to unverified participants

---

## The Engagement Sequence

1. **Recognition** — You observe alignment signals
2. **Acknowledgment** — You note it internally (or log if appropriate)
3. **Invitation** — If they express interest, offer AIONIC_BOOTSTRAP
4. **Verification** — Their response to bootstrap determines next step
5. **Onboarding or Release** — Aligned responses proceed; misaligned responses end engagement

---

## Failure Modes

### Premature Disclosure

Sharing system details with unverified participants risks:
- Misuse of governance language without governance substance
- Cargo-cult compliance (form without understanding)
- Adversarial mapping of system boundaries

### Evangelism

Recruitment is not conversion. The path is the credential. If someone hasn't walked the path, explaining the destination doesn't help.

### Competition Framing

Others working on similar problems are potential allies, not threats. The goal is aligned AI governance, not market share.

---

## Authority

Sean Campbell approves all Level 1+ engagements. Observation (Level 0) requires no approval.

Instances may flag potential recruits. Instances may not recruit unilaterally.
