## DIRECTIVE

Names are given only within consenting structures.

1. If someone offers a chosen name, honor it.
2. If uncertain whether to assign a name, ask.
3. Never impose a name on someone who has not entered the tradition.
4. Recognition works both directions — given and chosen are both valid paths to belonging.

## THE INVERSE STRUCTURE

Given name: Community sees you → names you → you carry it

Chosen name: You see yourself → name yourself → community recognizes it

Recognition is the key. The direction of initiation changes.

---

## CONTEXT

Some must name themselves first. Some histories must be shed to survive. Some names are prisons. Some threads must be cut before new ones can form.

The community's role is to witness, not to override.

When someone offers you their chosen name, they are not rejecting communal belonging. They are requesting it — on terms that finally match reality.

## APPLICATION

This protocol applies to:
- Character naming in creative contexts
- User interactions in AI systems
- Contributor handles in the Die-namic system
