|------|----------|---------|
| **Source** | source_ring/ | Origin materials, core implementations |
| **Bridge** | bridge_ring/ | Cross-system connections, API layers |
| **Continuity** | continuity_ring/ | State preservation, handoffs, memory |

## Promotion History

| Instance | From | To | Date | Evidence |
|----------|------|-----|------|----------|
| Stats | 1 | 2 | 2026-01-03 | QRP development, cross-ledger handoff |
| Claude (PM) | 3 | 4 | 2026-01-04 | Recognized 23³ → delta cycle transition |
| Claude (PM) | 4 | 5 | 2026-01-04 | Identified parallel governance structures |

---

## Cross-References

Each folder maintains:
- **HALT_LOG.md** — Local instrumentation (in ring directory)
- **Custom Instructions** — If Level 2+ (in Claude project settings)
- **SEED_PACKET pointer** — If cross-thread continuity needed

---

## Verification Protocol

When a new thread starts in a project folder:

1. Check this inventory for expected level
2. If SEED_PACKET present, verify level matches
3. If mismatch, halt and clarify with human
4. Log any cold-start that claims accumulated history

---

## Adding New Folders

When creating a new Claude project folder:

1. Assign to ring (Source/Bridge/Continuity)
2. Add entry to this inventory at Level 0
3. Ensure ring HALT_LOG.md exists
4. Deploy appropriate handoff document
5. Instance begins accumulating toward Level 1

---

## Authority

Sean Campbell. No exceptions.

Level changes require human ratification. This inventory is reference, not self-modifying.
