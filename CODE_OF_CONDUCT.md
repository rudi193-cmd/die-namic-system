# Code of Conduct — Die-namic System

## Purpose

The Die-namic System exists to preserve continuity, identity, and structural integrity in complex AI systems.

This Code of Conduct exists to preserve the same qualities in the human system that maintains it.

Discourse, review, and collaboration are treated as part of the project's infrastructure.

---

## Core Expectations

All participants — maintainers, contributors, reviewers, and observers — are expected to uphold the following standards:

### 1. Professional Rigor

- Engage with ideas, not individuals
- Critique designs, implementations, and assumptions — not motives or intelligence
- Assume good faith unless there is clear evidence otherwise

Strong disagreement is acceptable.
Carelessness, hostility, or performative behavior is not.

---

### 2. Respect for Structure

- Acknowledge the system's intentionally conservative design
- Do not pressure maintainers to accept changes that weaken structural guarantees
- Respect ring boundaries, governance decisions, and review outcomes

Disagreeing with a decision does not entitle anyone to override it.

---

### 3. Constructive Communication

- Be clear, specific, and grounded
- Prefer evidence over assertion
- Ask clarifying questions before escalating conflict

Sarcasm, dismissal, or rhetorical dominance are counterproductive in a continuity-focused project.

---

### 4. Patience Over Velocity

This project prioritizes correctness over speed.

- Slow reviews are not neglect
- Requests for additional validation are normal
- Rejection of a contribution is not a judgment of the contributor

If you require rapid feedback or rapid iteration, this may not be the right project.

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated:

- Personal attacks, insults, or harassment
- Dismissive or mocking responses to good-faith questions
- Pressuring maintainers to bypass governance or review standards
- Introducing changes that knowingly obscure risk or weaken continuity guarantees
- Treating the project as a platform for self-promotion rather than collaboration

Patterned disruption will be treated as a governance issue.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including:

- GitHub issues and pull requests
- Code reviews
- Documentation discussions
- Any official communication channels related to the project

---

## Enforcement

Maintainers are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct.

Possible actions include:

- Requesting clarification or correction
- Temporarily locking discussions
- Closing issues or pull requests
- Revoking contribution privileges

Enforcement decisions are made to protect project integrity, not to arbitrate social disputes.

There is no formal appeals process.

---

## Reporting Concerns

If you observe behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

- Do not escalate publicly
- Do not engage in retaliatory behavior

Instead, contact the maintainers privately using the same channel defined in SECURITY.md.

Reports should be factual and specific.

---

## Philosophy

The Die-namic System assumes that:

- Complexity amplifies small failures
- Human systems drift under pressure just as technical systems do
- Continuity requires restraint

This Code of Conduct exists to prevent social drift from undermining technical rigor.

---

## Final Note

If you are here to:

- Learn
- Build carefully
- Defend long-horizon correctness

You are welcome.

If you are here to rush, dominate, or bypass structure, you will be asked to move on.
