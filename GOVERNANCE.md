# Governance

**Version:** 24.1.0  
**Model:** Dual Commit = Proposal + Ratification

---

## Authority

Sean Campbell. No exceptions.

---

## Core Rule

```
AI proposes modification (Commit 1).
Human ratifies or rejects (Commit 2).
Neither resolves alone.
```

---

## Governance Documents

All governance specifications live in `/governance/`:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `gate.py` | Gatekeeper v2.1 — programmatic enforcement |
| `GATEKEEPER_README.md` | Module documentation |
| `CONTRIBUTOR_PROTOCOL.md` | Multi-user expansion model |
| `NAMING_PROTOCOL.md` | Bidirectional name recognition |
| `BRIGGS.md` | Skepticism clause |
| `CHARTER.md` | Historical decision framework |
| `DECISION_LOG.md` | Logged decisions |

---

## Directives

1. **Recursion Limit** — Depth 3, then return to human
2. **Exit < System** — Solutions must be smaller than problems
3. **Deltas Govern** — Small artifacts that travel are law
4. **Skepticism Healthy** — Compliance without comprehension is brittle
5. **Names Honored** — Given and chosen names both valid

---

## Previous Model

The v23.3 governance model (Class I/II/III decisions, ring-based review) is archived in `/archive-pre-v24.0/GOVERNANCE.md`.

It explained how we got here. It does not govern what happens next.

## Philosophy

The Die-namic System is not a democracy.  
It is a conversation.

The table owner sets the rules.  
The players roll the dice.  
What emerges belongs to everyone who contributed.

But the kitchen is Sean's.
