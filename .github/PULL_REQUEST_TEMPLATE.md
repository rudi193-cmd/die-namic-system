---

## Motivation

Why is this change necessary?
What problem does it solve?

---

## Continuity Impact Assessment

Does this change affect:
- Identity preservation?
- Memory coherence?
- Structural invariants?

Explain clearly.

---

## Validation Performed

List tests, simulations, or analyses performed.

- Long-horizon / recursive validation (if applicable):

---

## Risk Analysis

What could go wrong?
How is that risk mitigated?

---

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] README
- [ ] /docs
- [ ] None required (explain why)

---

## Final Checklist

- [ ] Ring isolation preserved
- [ ] No undocumented cross-ring coupling
- [ ] Validation artifacts included
- [ ] This change does not weaken structure-locked status
