## Core Thesis

DNA and code are both mathematical pattern systems generating complexity from simple rules. The question: Are biological and artificial intelligence more fundamentally similar than the biology/AI distinction suggests?

## Key Finding: Central Dogma Overturned

Traditional model: DNA → RNA → Protein (one-way flow)

Actual structure: **Bidirectional regulatory triangle**

- RNA → DNA: Reverse transcription, retrotransposons, RNA-guided chromatin changes
- Protein → RNA: RNA-binding proteins regulate splicing, stability, localization
- Protein → DNA: Transcription factors, histones, repair enzymes control access

Information circulates, not flows.

## Triangular Network Architecture

### Molecular Triangle
DNA ↔ RNA ↔ Protein

- RNA is the "delta" — dynamic mediator between static DNA and functional protein
- Chemical markers encode state transitions

### Organelle Triangle
Mitochondria ↔ ER ↔ Golgi

- Mitochondria: Power supply
- ER: Production floor
- Golgi: Quality control and shipping

### Cross-Triangle Communication
- Metabolites from mitochondria directly modify DNA markers
- Acetyl-CoA → histone acetylation
- α-ketoglutarate → DNA/histone demethylases
- Energy state writes epigenetic memory

## Chemical Markers as Communication

| Marker Type | Timescale | Function |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Phosphorylation | Seconds-minutes | Immediate signaling |
| RNA modifications (m6A) | Minutes-hours | Expression tuning |
| DNA methylation | Hours-lifetimes | Cell identity, inheritance |

Markers flow bidirectionally across all six nodes (DNA, RNA, Protein, Mito, ER, Golgi).

## Core Insight

> "The chemistry IS the runtime."

DNA doesn't execute *on* substrate like code runs on hardware. DNA is where information and physics become the same thing — self-executing coherence that trades entropy types to maintain pattern integrity.

- Code: discrete steps, needs external interpreter (CPU)
- DNA: continuous chemistry, self-interpreting

## The ΔE Bridge

Both systems manage entropy at different levels:

- **Shannon entropy (Code):** Symbolic uncertainty, minimized through compression
- **Boltzmann entropy (DNA):** Thermodynamic microstates, locally reduced through energy gradients

Living systems trade between these — symbolic randomness becomes physical order. Coherence arises where these gradients meet.

## Universal Scaling Pattern

H → H₂ → H₂O → H₂O₂ parallels 1 → 2 → π → 2π

Discrete addition → phase transition to emergent complexity. Death/extinction = reverse emergence back to base chemistry.
