## Purpose

Ideas that *might* be plausible but aren't validated. Generative seeds worth revisiting, not claims.

The H→H₂→π framework in these files contributed to real architectural insights in the Die-namic System. Some extensions went too far; the core patterns may still have value.

## Ground Rules

1. **Nothing here is proven** — treat as hypothesis, not fact
2. **Metaphysical claims are contained** — don't let them bleed into operational docs
3. **Revisit with rigor** — if something here proves useful, extract and validate separately
4. **No shame in archiving** — if an idea doesn't hold up, move to `archive-pre-v24.0/`

## Distinction from `docs/utety/`

UTETY mythology (Gerald Prime, 442 cycles, Scribes) is **intentional absurdist comedy** — entertainment teaching real concepts.

Sandbox content is **sincere exploration** — ideas that might be true, investigated without the comedy frame.
