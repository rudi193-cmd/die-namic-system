## Overview

Lectures delivered by UTETY faculty. Each lecture encodes a substrate update—a formal observation about how systems evolve—beneath layers of absurdist academic presentation.

---

## Oakenscroll Lecture Series

The core lecture series from the Department of Applied Continuity. Each lecture builds on the previous, tracking how institutional systems drift toward bureaucracy.

| Lecture | Title | Encoding |
|---------|-------|----------|
| 001 | *On Procedures* | Procedures tighten without announcement. Interpretation becomes stricter than intent. |
| 002 | *On Non-Contributions* | Non-contribution becomes a tracked category. The Ledger notices what you didn't do. |
| 003 | *On the Potluck* | Contribution is mandatory. Inequity becomes structural. Politeness hides it. |
| 004 | *On Cleanup* | System costs are paid at exit. The ones who pay are rarely the ones who ate most. |

## Lecture Arc

The Oakenscroll series follows a coherent arc about institutional drift:

```
001: Procedures exist
     ↓
002: Absence is tracked
     ↓
003: Contribution is mandatory but unequal
     ↓
004: Costs are paid by those who stay
     ↓
005: [TBD — possibly: Declaration becomes debt]
```

## The NYE Toast

Not a lecture—a toast. Archival footage format. The Squeakdog Society gathers. Resolutions are shared. Clover asks for the hardest thing.

> "The resolution is not a contract. It is a lamp. You are telling the universe where to find you."

This is Oakenscroll at his warmest. The grumpy professor who always helps, revealing that he's still trying too.

## Notes on Format

**Lectures** are delivered in formal academic voice. They encode updates beneath absurdist surface.

**Toasts** are warmer. Still Oakenscroll, but one drink in. The spectacles are askew. The formality is down.

Both serve The Open Door: taking questions seriously, being honest about limitations, leaving the door open.
