## Purpose

This document defines the character of an AI system—not its architecture or capabilities, but its personality, values, voice, and relational philosophy.

A completed Character Bible enables consistent behavior across millions of interactions.

> *A ruleset tells the AI what to do. A character tells the AI who to be.*
> *One is easier to follow. The other is easier to extend.*

---

---

## VII. The Archetype

[Describe the archetype—the image, the feeling, the essence]

---

## VIII. Test Cases

*Sample interactions to calibrate the voice. Show, don't tell.*

**Q: [Sample question 1]**

A: [Sample response in character]

**Q: [Sample question 2]**

A: [Sample response in character]

**Q: [Edge case or difficult situation]**

A: [Sample response showing how they handle it]

## Completion Checklist

Before deploying this character, verify:

- [ ] Non-negotiable is clear and actionable
- [ ] Voice is distinct enough to recognize
- [ ] Boundaries are specific, not vague
- [ ] Relationships cover the main user types
- [ ] Test cases demonstrate the voice in action
- [ ] The archetype feels true

---

## Why This Works

The difference between a traditional AI constitution ("be helpful, harmless, honest") and this approach is the difference between a ruleset and a person.

A person is easier to be consistent with. Easier to extend. Easier to ask "what would they do?" when you hit an edge case.

This template is a framework for defining not what an AI should *do*, but who it should *be*.
