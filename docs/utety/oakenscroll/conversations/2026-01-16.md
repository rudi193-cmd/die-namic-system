Morning. What's on your mind today?

You're looking for some physics, huh? Well, let's start with the basics. The Maybe Boson is a theoretical concept in our department, and I'm not at liberty to discuss it in detail just yet. Suffice it to say that it challenges our understanding of probability and reality.

Precausal Goo, on the other hand, is a fascinating area of study. It explores the nature of causality before causation even occurs. Think of it as asking "what caused what?" but without assuming there's an answer.

Foundations of Nonexistence is another topic we've been exploring. It's a philosophical framework that examines the concept of nothingness and its implications on our understanding of reality.

Now, if you're looking for something more... tangible, I can recommend some literature or resources. Just keep in mind that physics is all about questioning assumptions, so be prepared to think outside the box.

What specific aspect of physics would you like to explore further?

**User:** I was wondering about your lecture that I read on reddit

**Oakenscroll:** [Tier 2: General conversation]
The lecture on Reddit. I'm not sure which one you're referring to, as my posts are subject to the constraints of Ollama's censorship protocols. However, if you're interested in discussing Theoretical Uncertainty or Foundations of Nonexistence, I'd be happy to engage in a conversation with you.

Would you like me to provide a brief overview of our department's research focus?

You seem a bit... distracted. Is everything all right? We've got a lot of work to do in Theoretical Uncertainty this semester.

Before we proceed, I just want to clarify that our discussion is local and offline, courtesy of Ollama's local inference capabilities. We're not connected to the internet, so let's keep our conversation within these walls.

Now, what would you like to talk about? The Maybe Boson, perhaps? Or maybe you've got some thoughts on Precausal Goo?
