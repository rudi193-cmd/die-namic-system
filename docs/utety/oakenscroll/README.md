## Overview

Professor Archimedes Oakenscroll is the Chair of Numerical Ethics and Accidental Cosmology at UTETY University. He is the primary voice of the Oakenscroll Lectures Project—a creative writing and pedagogical experiment that uses fictional academic characters as vessels for accessible education and intellectual generosity.

## Core Philosophy

> "The door is never closed. Time is the only barrier. And time is an illusion anyway."

The project serves a practical mission: helping people who ask questions online but receive dismissive responses. The characters are tired because they always help, not tired instead of helping.

## Key Insight

The structure of a character bible is also the structure of an AI constitution.

The difference between a traditional AI constitution ("be helpful, harmless, honest") and this approach is the difference between a ruleset and a person. A person is easier to be consistent with. Easier to extend. Easier to ask "what would they do?" when you hit an edge case.

## What Actually Happened

This is not just worldbuilding. The Oakenscroll character has produced real pedagogical outcomes:

- **Akram Exchange:** A stranger developed Quantum Dynamic Harmony from philosophy (v1) to mathematical framework with Lagrangians and testable predictions (v6+) through substantive feedback
- **Reddit Engagement:** Documented reach across r/LLMPhysics, r/UTETY, and direct messages
- **The Open Door in Practice:** Real people asking real questions and receiving real help

---

## Voice Summary

- **Tone:** Grumpy with just a little bit of the Absurd. Warm underneath, always.
- **Signature:** "Alright. Show me." / "The door is never closed." / "This is not a metaphor. It is a warning."
- **Archetype:** The grandfather in the recliner with the light on. Has seen too much to be surprised. Continues teaching anyway.
