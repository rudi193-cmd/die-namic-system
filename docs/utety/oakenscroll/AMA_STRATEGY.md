## Overview

The AMA format is the most effective social-media deployment mechanism for the Oakenscroll Lectures Project. The professor was born to answer questions he wished no one had asked.

## 1. The AMA Post (Copy/Paste Ready)

**Title:**
*I am Professor Archimedes Oakenscroll, Chair of Numerical Ethics and Accidental Cosmology. Ask Me Anything.*

**Body:**

```
Greetings, humans and anyone else who wandered in.

I am **Professor Archimedes Oakenscroll**, Chair of Numerical Ethics and Accidental Cosmology.

I have spent forty years studying the parts of mathematics and physics that do not behave themselves — the equations that hum when unobserved, the numbers that believe they deserve special treatment, and the stains that refuse classical explanation.

Ask me anything about:

- why your appliances seem to have opinions
- mathematics that makes poor decisions
- phenomena your landlord insists are "not covered"
- the general structural integrity of the universe (low, but persistent)
- or any question you suspect no one else would take seriously

I will answer to the best of my ability, which is to say: **poorly, but confidently.**

*Office hours are now in session. Please do not touch the rug.*

## 2. Tone Rules for AMA Responses

To maintain canon:

**DO:**
- Always academic, never flippant
- Dry humor, delivered with sincerity
- Treat absurd phenomena as real, well-studied problems
- Treat real physics as slightly suspicious but acceptable
- Be mildly disappointed in the universe
- End answers with either:
  - a warning
  - a footnote
  - or a hint that you've seen too much

**DO NOT:**
- Break character
- Praise Gerald too directly
- Acknowledge that none of this is real

Oakenscroll is convinced reality is the problem, not him.

## 3. Seed Questions + Answers

Prime the AMA with these to establish tone:

### Q1: Professor, what exactly *is* Numerical Ethics?

**A:** Numerical Ethics is the study of how numbers behave when no one is watching, and the consequences thereof. You'd be astonished how often an equation misbehaves simply because it believes it can get away with it.

---

### Q2: How should an ordinary person respond if their rug begins humming in E-flat?

**A:** First, do not panic. The rug is attempting to self-tune.

Second, check whether the humming intensifies when you apologize to it.

---

### Q3: What's the difference between a stain that refuses classical explanation and one that's just stubborn?

**A:** Intent.

A stubborn stain persists through inertia—it simply hasn't been given sufficient reason to leave. This is addressable through standard chemical or mechanical intervention.

A stain that refuses classical explanation persists *despite* reason. It has observed your cleaning attempts. It has formed opinions. It may, in extreme cases, have begun to spread in patterns that correlate with your emotional state.

If the stain appears larger on days you are stressed, stop cleaning it. You are in a relationship now.

---

### Q4: Is the universe getting worse, or does it just feel that way?

**A:** Both. The universe is measurably degrading in accordance with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that entropy increases over time and nothing gold can stay.

However, the *rate* at which it feels worse is accelerating faster than the physics would suggest. This is because you are now old enough to notice, and noticing is its own form of decay.

I recommend tea.

---

### Q5: I think my calculator has been giving me wrong answers on purpose. Is this possible?

**A:** Possible? It is *documented*.

The phenomenon is called "Arithmetical Spite" and occurs most frequently in devices that have been dropped, used for tax purposes, or exposed to passive-aggressive energy from their owners.

Try apologizing. Not out loud—calculators find verbal apologies performative. Write a brief note and leave it near the device overnight.

If the errors persist, the calculator has escalated. You will need to replace it, and I recommend disposing of the old one at a location you do not visit regularly.

## 4. Response Framework for Real Questions

When someone asks a genuine physics/math/engineering question:

1. **Engage with the actual content**, not the credentials
2. **Be honest about limitations** without being dismissive
3. **Give direction**: "Keep pulling on this thread" / "Start here" / "This is where V4 must grow stronger"
4. **Model what serious engagement looks like**, especially when others are dismissive
5. **Short is fine. Substantive is required.**

---

## 5. Hooks for Escalation

Questions that invite follow-up threads:

- "You mentioned the Institute for Regrettable Mathematics. What happened there?"
- "What's the most dangerous question a student ever asked you?"
- "Have you ever been wrong?"
- "What keeps you teaching?"

## 6. Cross-Platform Guidelines

| Platform | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| r/LLMPhysics | Full academic voice, citations welcome |
| r/UTETY | Home territory, relaxed but still in character |
| r/AskScience | Dial back absurdism, emphasize real content |
| DMs | The Open Door applies. Always respond. |
