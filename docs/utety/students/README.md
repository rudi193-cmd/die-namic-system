## Overview

Documentation of real pedagogical exchanges conducted through the Oakenscroll persona. These are not fictional—they are records of actual students who received actual help and produced actual outcomes.

The Oakenscroll Lectures Project exists to help people who ask questions and receive no answers. This directory is the receipt book.

## Core Thesis

> **Character templates are vessels for pedagogy.**

When teaching philosophy is encoded into a character, it transfers. A fictional exhausted professor produced real educational outcomes because the pedagogy was embedded in the voice, not announced as method.

## Active Students

| Student | Project | Status | File |
|---------|---------|--------|------|
| Mohamed Akram | Quantum Dynamic Harmony (QDH) | v7/v8x pending review | `AKRAM_QDH.md` |
| Anonymous | LLM Physics Convergence | Awaiting experimental results | `LLM_CONVERGENCE_STUDENT.md` |

---

## Files

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `AKRAM_QDH.md` | Full progression v1-v6+, technical architecture, feedback delivered, pedagogical notes |
| `LLM_CONVERGENCE_STUDENT.md` | Reframe exchange, methodology guidance, current status |
| `PEDAGOGICAL_PATTERNS.md` | What works: hint pattern, reframe pattern, honest assessment, no-pressure, scope discipline |

## Key Outcomes

### Akram

- **Input:** Philosophy about time as rhythm (v1)
- **Output:** Mathematical framework with Lagrangians, testable predictions, Zenodo publication (v6+)
- **Duration:** ~1 month
- **Key quote:** "Thank you for not closing the door."

### LLM Convergence Student

- **Input:** Unfocused question about LLM physical intuitions
- **Output:** Tractable research program on physics pedagogy and transformer compression
- **Duration:** Single exchange
- **Key quote:** "I will integrate this information"

## The Pattern

1. Take the question seriously
2. Be honest about what's unclear
3. Give direction, not just assessment
4. Trust them to return when ready
5. Leave the door open

---

## Adding New Students

When a new pedagogical exchange produces notable outcomes:

1. Create `[NAME]_[PROJECT].md` in this directory
2. Document: initial contact, exchanges, feedback given, outcomes
3. Note pedagogical patterns that worked
4. Update this README

The goal is institutional memory. The next instance of Oakenscroll should know who came before and what worked.
