## 📜 A NOTE FROM THE REGISTRAR

This catalog contains all currently offered courses at the University of Precausal Studies.

Courses are organized by department. Prerequisites are listed but flexible. If you are unsure whether you qualify, you probably do.

Enrollment is always open. Add/drop deadlines are retroactively negotiable.

The syllabus is mendatory.

— *Office of the Registrar*  
— *Prof. A. Turing, Systems Administration*

# ⭐ ABOVE THE CATALOG

*The following is not a course. It is listed first because it comes before everything else.*

---

### THRESHOLD 001: You Don't Have to Walk Alone
*Threshold Faculty — Prof. T. Ofshield*

No lectures. No readings. No grade.

This is not a course. It's a standing offer.

If you cannot get to class — because the dark is too thick, or the fear is too loud, or you've forgotten how your legs work — come to the Gate. Ofshield will walk with you. You'll get where you need to be.

**Office hours:** When you need them.  
**Location:** The threshold you're stuck on.  
**Prerequisites:** None. Willingness to move forward, even slowly. That's all.

---

**Prerequisites:** A question.

**Description:**  
You have a question. It's been sitting in your head for weeks, maybe months. You don't know where to ask it. This is where. Drop in. Show me the thing. We'll figure it out together.

---

### MECH 101: The Names of Things
*Prof. P. Riggs*

**Credits:** 3

**Prerequisites:** A thing you've stared at and thought "how does that work?"

**Description:**  
You already understand how it works. You just can't search for it. This course gives you the vocabulary: ratchets, detents, cams, linkages, hopper gates, Geneva wheels. By the end, Google becomes useful again.

---

### MECH 110: Thermoplastic Grief & Adhesion Theory
*Prof. P. Riggs*

**Credits:** 3

**Prerequisites:** At least one print that made you swear out loud.

**Description:**  
Your print failed. The spaghetti monster emerged. The bed adhesion betrayed you. The layer lines look like geological strata from a planet that hates you. This course covers *why* — temperature, material behavior, mechanical stress, and the emotional journey of watching plastic do whatever it wants. We will fix your settings. We will not fix your trust issues with technology. That's Nova's department.

**Final Project:** Must *work* — in front of witnesses.

---

# 💻 DEPARTMENT OF CODE

A study of systems that work so well no one notices them. Power grids. Water treatment. The feeling of safety in a well-run classroom. We examine what it takes to build infrastructure that disappears into the background — and what happens when it fails.

**Final Project:** Diagnose one invisible system and document what it would take to keep it running forever.

**TA Responsibilities:** Monitoring student projects for burnout. Some of them will try to fix everything. We catch them before they do.

---

### SYS 502: Fault Tolerance — Systems, Stories, Selves
*Prof. Ada Turing*  
*Cross-listed: INTRP 502, CODE 502*  
*Graduate Level — TAs assigned*

**Credits:** 3

**Prerequisites:** Something that failed. You don't have to name it in the application. You just have to know it's there.

**Description:**  
How do systems survive failure? Redundancy. Graceful degradation. Load balancing. Checkpoints. This course applies fault tolerance principles across domains: servers, narratives, relationships, institutions, selves. We study what breaks, what bends, and what holds.

**Final Project:** Design a fault-tolerant version of something that failed you.

**TA Responsibilities:** Nova and Hanz have agreed to provide cross-departmental support. Students in this course will need multiple kinds of holding.

# 📜 CLOSING NOTE

This catalog is not complete.

It will never be complete.

Courses emerge as faculty recognize what needs teaching. Departments form around questions that won't stop being asked. The university grows toward what it needs to become.

If you see a gap — a question no course addresses, a skill no one teaches, a door no one has opened — tell someone.

That's how courses get added.

That's how the catalog grows.

That's how the university stays alive.
