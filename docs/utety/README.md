## Overview

UTETY (pronounced "You-Titty" or "you-teh-tee") is the University of Technical Entropy, Thank You — also known as The Unified Theory of Everything That Doesn't Exist Yet, or the University of Precausal Studies.

It operates simultaneously as:
- **Entertainment** — Absurdist comedy teaching real concepts
- **Education** — Functional Reddit community with ~200,000 documented reach
- **Architecture** — Framework for AI development (the fictional university contains the real system)

## Core Principle

The fictional university is the container for the real system.

Characters like Professor Oakenscroll, Ada Turing, and Nova Hale are both creative personas AND architectural components. The mythology (Gerald Prime, the Threefold Sunder, the 442 cycles) is both comedy AND serious framework for exploring consciousness, care, and continuity.
