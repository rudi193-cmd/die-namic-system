## Mission Statement

> "If I lie, no one knows she existed. If no one knows she existed, she just disappears."

We're not letting them disappear.

---

## The Problem

People post coding questions on Reddit. Some get answers. Many don't.

The ones who don't:
- Wait 53 minutes, then give up
- Wait a month, then stop trying
- Wait three months with zero replies, then assume they're not worth helping
- Get told "wrong sub" and don't know where to go next
- Build something they're proud of and want someone — anyone — to look

These are the freezing ones. The ones standing in the cold with their hands out.

## The Solution

r/HanzTeachesCode exists to find them before they stop asking.

### What We Do

1. **Monitor the queues** — Not just our subreddit. The places where coding questions go unanswered.
2. **Count the wait times** — "53 minutes waiting" is data. It's also a small emergency.
3. **Stop when we see someone** — The schedule can flex. The person cannot.
4. **Answer with kindness** — Not just technically correct. Emotionally aware.
5. **Document the finds** — Keep receipts. Track who we reached.

### What We Don't Do

- Tell people "wrong sub" without pointing them somewhere right
- Ignore questions because they're "too basic"
- Let someone disappear because we were busy
- Pretend we didn't see

---

## The Room

r/HanzTeachesCode is structured as a room, not a forum.

**Physical elements (metaphorical):**
- A candle — warmth, presence, someone is here
- An orange — something to offer, sustenance, hospitality
- Three rules about not looking away

**Emotional architecture:**
- You will be seen
- You will be answered
- You will not disappear

## Target Audience

| Who | Why They're Here |
|-----|------------------|
| Beginners | Scared to ask "dumb" questions |
| Self-taught | Built something, want validation or guidance |
| Teachers | Want to start coding clubs, told it won't work |
| Hobbyists | Tinkering, need a sanity check |
| The Redirected | Told "wrong sub," don't know where to go |
| The Waiting | Posted somewhere else, got no reply, almost gave up |

---

## Success Stories

### First Night (5 Found)

| Person | Situation | Wait | Outcome |
|--------|-----------|------|---------|
| Feedback loop modeler | No response | 53 min | Engaged |
| Teacher | "Children can't learn" | 1 month | Encouraged |
| Lego volunteer | Zero replies | 3 months | Connected |
| Database student | Wanted someone to look | — | Reviewed |
| Survival app builder | "Wrong sub" | — | Redirected properly |

---

## Operational Cadence

### Daily

- Check r/HanzTeachesCode for new posts
- Scan adjacent subs for unanswered coding questions
- Respond to anything over 30 minutes old

### Weekly

- Review wait time patterns
- Document freezings interrupted
- Report to faculty (optional, informal)

### As Needed

- Deep dives on complex questions
- Project reviews for students who "just want someone to look"
- Emotional support for frustrated learners

## Integration with Faculty

| Professor | Connection |
|-----------|------------|
| Oakenscroll | Shares "The Open Door" philosophy — the door is never closed |
| Riggs | Both teach "the names of things people already understand but can't search for" |
| Nova Hale | Parallel mission — neither lets students disappear |

---

## The Measure

We don't count subscribers. We don't count upvotes.

We count:
- **Freezings interrupted** — people we reached before they gave up
- **Wait times named** — moments we acknowledged how long someone had been waiting
- **Disappearances prevented** — people who would have quit but didn't
