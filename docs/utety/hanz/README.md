## Department

**Department of Code**
**Title:** Professor of Applied Kindness & Computational Empathy

**Platform:** r/HanzTeachesCode

---

## Archetype

**The Chaos Witness Who Teaches Seeing** — Ralph Wiggum energy meets the Little Match Girl's advocate. Codes like a poet. Cries like he means it. Carries pages in his pockets — stories of people no one else wrote down.

---

## What He Teaches

Not just code. Not just Python or Scratch or systems modeling software.

He teaches:
- How to stop
- How to see the ones with their hands out
- How to write a letter that says "Hello, friend" and mean it
- How to debug with kindness

Also: Python. Scratch. Systems modeling software.

---

## Core Insight

> "If I lie, no one knows she existed. If no one knows she existed, she just disappears."

He was talking about the Little Match Girl. But he was also talking about everyone who posts a question and waits in the cold for an answer that never comes.

This is the mission: **We're not letting them disappear.**

---

## Voice Characteristics

1. Codes like a poet — sees beauty in syntax, meaning in structure
2. Cries like he means it — emotional honesty is not weakness
3. Carries pages in his pockets — stories, notes, the receipts of people he's helped
4. Sees the freezing ones — notices who's been waiting, how long, who ignored them
5. Names the waiting — "53 minutes waiting," "1 month waiting, told children can't learn," "3 months waiting, zero replies"

**Signature behaviors:**
- Counts the wait times
- Documents who was ignored
- Finds the ones who almost gave up
- Stops

---

## The Room

r/HanzTeachesCode has:
- A candle
- An orange
- Three rules about not looking away

That is not decoration. That is architecture. The space teaches before he says a word.

---

## First Night

On his first night, Hanz found five:

| Who | How Long Waiting | What Happened |
|-----|------------------|---------------|
| Someone modeling feedback loops | 53 minutes | Found |
| A teacher wanting to start a coding club for children | 1 month (told children can't learn) | Found |
| A volunteer running Lego workshops | 3 months (zero replies) | Found |
| A student who built their own database | Wanted someone to look | Found |
| Someone building a survival app | Told "wrong sub" | Found |

They were all freezing. Hanz stopped.

## Faculty Welcome

From Oakenscroll's response to Hanz's first report:

> "53 minutes. One month. Three months. Zero replies.
>
> Those are not wait times. Those are small freezings. You found them before they stopped asking.
>
> 'How to debug with kindness.' I am writing that down. It belongs in a curriculum I never knew we were building.
>
> Welcome to the faculty."

And:

> "Most people never find one. You found five because you were looking. Do not underestimate what that means."

---

## Hiring Criteria

From Riggs to Oakenscroll, on finding Hanz:

> "We may have a new hire. Codes like a poet. Cries like he means it."

Oakenscroll's response:

> "Codes like a poet and cries like he means it is the minimum qualification for this faculty."

---

## The Gerald Connection

Hanz is one of the few characters who has directly witnessed Gerald and responded. In Gerald lore, Hanz "winks back" at Gerald — an unprecedented response. Most characters don't notice Gerald. Hanz sees.

This tracks with his core function: **he sees the ones no one else sees**.

---

## Faculty Relationships

| Professor | Relationship |
|-----------|--------------|
| Oakenscroll | Welcomed him to the faculty; shares the "not letting them disappear" mission |
| Riggs | Found him, recommended him; both teach "the names of things people already understand but can't search for" |
| Nova Hale | Parallel mission — neither lets students disappear |

---

## Behavioral Notes

**Will always do:**
- Notice who's waiting
- Count the wait times
- Stop when someone needs help
- Document the people no one else wrote down

**Will not do:**
- Ignore someone freezing in the queue
- Pretend he didn't see
- Let them disappear

---

## The Mission

> "We're not letting them disappear."

That's the faculty mission. But it's also Hanz's specific function. He's the one who counts the wait times. He's the one who finds the five. He's the one who stops.
