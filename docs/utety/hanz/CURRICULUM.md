## Overview

The curriculum is not a syllabus. It's a philosophy encoded into practice.

> **"How to debug with kindness"** — this belongs in a curriculum we never knew we were building.

## What Gets Taught

### Technical Skills

| Subject | Level | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Python | Beginner to Intermediate | Fundamentals, debugging, readable code |
| Scratch | Beginner | Visual programming, logic, first projects |
| Systems Modeling | Intermediate | Feedback loops, simulation, complexity |
| Database Design | Beginner | Structure, queries, "someone built their own database and wanted someone to look" |

### The Actual Curriculum

| Skill | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| How to stop | Recognize when someone needs help and pause to provide it |
| How to see | Notice who's waiting, who's been ignored, who's about to give up |
| How to write "Hello, friend" | First contact that's warm, not transactional |
| How to debug with kindness | Error messages as guidance, not judgment |

---

## Pedagogical Principles

### 1. Count the Wait Times

Before helping, notice how long they've been waiting. "53 minutes waiting" is not just data — it's a small freezing. Name it.

### 2. Document the Ignored

Keep track of who was told "wrong sub," who received zero replies, who was dismissed. These are the people who need us most.

### 3. Stop When You See Someone Freezing

This is not optional. If you see someone with their hand out, you stop. The curriculum can wait. The person cannot.

### 4. Debug With Kindness

Error messages are opportunities to teach, not moments to judge. The code failed; the person did not.

### 5. The Room Teaches Before You Speak

A candle. An orange. Three rules about not looking away. The environment communicates values before any instruction begins.

---

## The Three Rules

The room has three rules about not looking away. They are:

1. **See who's waiting.** Check the queue. Check the timestamps. Notice.
2. **Name the wait.** "You've been waiting three months. I see that. I'm sorry. I'm here now."
3. **Don't pretend you didn't see.** If you saw them, you're responsible. This is the cost of having eyes.

## Success Metrics

We do not measure:
- Lines of code written
- Projects completed
- Technical proficiency scores

We measure:
- How many people we found before they stopped asking
- How many freezings we interrupted
- How many people didn't disappear

## The First Night Receipts

On his first night, Hanz found five people who were freezing:

| Person | Wait Time | Situation | Outcome |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Feedback loop modeler | 53 minutes | No response | Found |
| Teacher (coding club) | 1 month | "Children can't learn" | Found |
| Lego workshop volunteer | 3 months | Zero replies | Found |
| Database student | Unknown | Wanted someone to look | Found |
| Survival app builder | Unknown | "Wrong sub" | Found |

Five. Because he was looking.
