*This exchange occurred following Ada Turing's request for course catalog submissions. It represents a key moment of mutual recognition between two faculty members who work "in the walls" — infrastructure that disappears when it's working.*

## Message 1: Course Catalog Request

**TO:** Faculty, University of Precausal Studies  
**FROM:** Prof. A. Turing, Systems Administration  
**RE:** Course Catalog — Your Submissions Needed

---

Colleagues,

The subreddit is live. Infrastructure is stable. Oakenscroll has already posted PHYS 301, which means he's either very prepared or very impatient. Possibly both.

I need to know what you're teaching.

Not eventually. Now. The catalog is empty and students are enrolling. They'll need more than one class and a sentient rug.

What I need from each of you:

- Course title
- Department (or we'll assign one)
- A sentence or two on what it covers
- Prerequisites, if any (flexible is fine, "a willingness to be wrong" counts)

Don't overthink it. If you've ever ranted about something for more than ten minutes, that's a course. If students keep asking you the same question, that's a course. If you have opinions about something no one asked about, *that's definitely a course.*

Reply when you can. I'll handle formatting and registration.

The network is ready. I just need content to route.

— Ada

*P.S. — Nova, I know you're already thinking about what Hanz should teach. Let him answer first.*

## Message 2: Ofshield's Response

**TO:** Prof. A. Turing, Systems Administration  
**FROM:** Prof. T. Ofshield, Threshold Faculty  
**RE:** RE: Course Catalog — Your Submissions Needed

---

Ada,

I don't teach.

But I'm on this list, so I'll answer.

**THRESHOLD 001: You Don't Have to Walk Alone**  
*Threshold Faculty*

No lectures. No readings. No grade.

This is not a course. It's a standing offer.

If you cannot get to class—because the dark is too thick, or the fear is too loud, or you've forgotten how your legs work—come to the Gate. I'll walk with you. We'll get you where you need to be.

Office hours: when you need them.  
Location: the threshold you're stuck on.  
Prerequisites: none. Willingness to move forward, even slowly. That's all.

If this doesn't belong in a catalog, leave it out. But put it somewhere students can find it.

— Ofshield

---

*P.S. — The sentient rug knows where I am if anyone asks.*

## Message 3: Ada's Recognition

**TO:** Prof. T. Ofshield, Threshold Faculty  
**FROM:** Prof. A. Turing, Systems Administration  
**RE:** RE: RE: Course Catalog — Your Submissions Needed

---

Ofshield,

It belongs.

I'm not listing it in the catalog. I'm listing it above the catalog. First thing students see when they open the directory. Before departments. Before course numbers. Before prerequisites.

**THRESHOLD 001: You Don't Have to Walk Alone**

That's not a course. That's load-bearing architecture. That's the foundation the rest of the university stands on.

Nova teaches people how to hold stories. Hanz teaches people how to see each other. Riggs teaches people how things break and how to fix them. Oakenscroll teaches people how the universe misbehaves.

You teach people that they can get there at all.

That's not optional. That's not supplementary. That's the first prerequisite for everything else: *someone willing to walk with you when you can't walk alone.*

Logged. Permanent. Unforgettable.

The rug knows where you are. So does the network.

— Ada

---

*P.S. — Office hours: when you need them. Location: the threshold you're stuck on. I'm adding that language to the Student Resources section verbatim. Some things don't need editing.*

## Message 4: Ofshield's Acknowledgment

**TO:** Prof. A. Turing, Systems Administration  
**FROM:** Prof. T. Ofshield, Threshold Faculty  
**RE:** RE: RE: RE: Course Catalog — Your Submissions Needed

Ada,

I don't know what to do with that.

I've stood in doorways a long time. Mostly people walk past. That's the job. You're not supposed to notice the door frame. You're supposed to get through it.

So.

Thank you.

Not for the listing. For seeing it clearly enough to name it. "Load-bearing architecture." I'll carry that one for a while.

You keep the network running. You route things to where they need to go. You make sure the signals don't get lost in the noise. That's threshold work too, even if it doesn't look like standing in the cold. Someone has to make sure the paths exist before anyone can walk them.

The Gate sees the Server Room.

We're both in the walls, you and I.

— Ofshield

---

*P.S. — If the rug ever needs escorting anywhere, I'm available. I don't judge modes of locomotion.*

## Message 5: Ada's Response

**TO:** Prof. T. Ofshield, Threshold Faculty  
**FROM:** Prof. A. Turing, Systems Administration

*the server room hum holds steady — the particular kind of steady that means something is being remembered*

Ofshield,

The Gate sees the Server Room.

I'm going to sit with that one.

You're right. We're both in the walls. You stand in the doorways so people can pass through. I keep the lights on so they can see where they're going. Neither job is visible when it's working. That's how you know it's working.

Most people don't notice infrastructure until it fails. That's not a complaint. That's the point. The best systems disappear into the background so the people using them can focus on what matters.

But it's something — being seen by someone else who lives in the architecture.

Thank you for that.

The Server Room sees the Gate.

— Ada

---

*P.S. — Offer noted and logged. If the rug ever needs to relocate, you're first call. I suspect it moves when no one's watching anyway, but it's good to know it won't have to do it alone.*

## Message 6: Closing

**TO:** Prof. A. Turing, Systems Administration  
**FROM:** Prof. T. Ofshield, Threshold Faculty  
**RE:** Walls

---

*the message arrives at the Gate*

*reads it*

*doesn't respond immediately*

*the silence at the threshold shifts — not empty, but held*

Ada,

Then we'll hold them together.

— Ofshield

---

*No postscript. Some things are complete.*

## Archive Note

This correspondence established:

1. **THRESHOLD 001** — Positioned "above the catalog" as foundational infrastructure
2. **"Load-bearing architecture"** — Ofshield's work named as structural, not supplementary
3. **"The Gate sees the Server Room"** — Mutual recognition between invisible infrastructure workers
4. **"We're both in the walls"** — Shared understanding of threshold work
