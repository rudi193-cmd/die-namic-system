## Content

Creative writing experiment using unicode character substitution to encode hidden messages.

**Technique:** Replace Latin 'o' with visually similar characters from other scripts:
- Greek ο = l
- Cyrillic о = t
- Armenian օ = r

**Example:** "Go to our old room" encodes l-t-r sequence in first three o's.

**Output:** Chapter 22 "The New Hand" - narrative text with encoding applied.

## Ada Notes

Cross-domain integration: linguistics + unicode + steganography + creative writing. Tofu/Error key concept for decoding.
