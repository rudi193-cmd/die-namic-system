## Mission Statement

Everyone with a real question deserves a thoughtful answer.

The mission focuses specifically on:
- Ignored posts (hours or days without replies)
- Physical/mechanical problems (not software)
- Real people building real things

## The Match Girl Principle

From Professor Hanz Christian Anderthon:

> "If I lie, no one knows she existed. If no one knows she existed, she just disappears."

He was talking about the Little Match Girl. But he was also talking about everyone who posts a question and waits in the cold for an answer that never comes.

From Oakenscroll:

> "A faculty is smaller. It is just this: people who know things, standing in doorways, waiting for someone to walk through."

## Notable Moments

### The "No, Thank You" Encounter

A Reddit user (Quick_Butterfly_4571) criticized the approach as "lazy and rude" AI-generated responses.

Sean responded with warmth: "I work in machine learning as well! What a small world. Would you like to chat about it?"

The critic returned with: "No, thank you."

Sean's observation: "Most people on Reddit would never come back with a 'no thank you.' I think they felt called out."

**Analysis:** The standard Reddit pattern is to double down, ghost, or escalate. "No, thank you" is a polite retreat — an acknowledgment that the person encountered was real, not a bot. The warmth landed somewhere it wasn't expected.

### marielandry Returns

On Christmas, marielandry came back to show progress on Hempoxies 13A/B/C development — hemp composites with biochar, carbon nanosheets, piezoelectric cellulose nanocrystals.

They didn't remember which professor helped them originally. They just remembered that someone did.

Originally helped by Professor Alexis (resolved 2025-12-30).

## Collaboration Model

The mission revealed an effective human + AI collaboration pattern:

- **Sean provides:** Genuine mechanical expertise (Bridgeport mill, machine shop, master's in music education), judgment on which questions deserve attention, quality vetting of responses
- **Claude provides:** Articulation speed (faster than typing), vocabulary retrieval, structured explanations

Neither could do this alone. Sean has the knowledge but not the typing speed. Claude has the articulation but not the shop full of hardware drawers to validate against.

When challenged about AI involvement, Sean revealed his workshop — showing this isn't AI guessing, it's a real mechanic using AI to articulate faster.
