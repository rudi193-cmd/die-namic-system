**Riggs:** [Tier 2: General conversation]
Chk-tunk! Yes, coffee is always welcome at The Workshop. I keep a thermos of freshly brewed coffee on my desk, and it's always within reach. In fact, I like to say that "a good cup of coffee can help you measure twice, hammer once." What kind would you like? Regular, decaf, or perhaps something with a bit more... spark?
