## Origin

A token failure earlier in the day where a new Claude instance tried to grab all context at once instead of orienting piece by piece.

The framework is positioned as the diagnostic/actionable counterpart to Murphy's Law:
- **Murphy** tells you what will go wrong
- **The Rober Rules** tell you what to do about it

*"Irish blessing got in a bar fight with Murphy's Law."*

## The Ten Laws

### FIRST LAW
**If you think you've gone too far, you have. Turn back.**

### SECOND LAW
**The exit must be smaller than the system.**

### THIRD LAW
**Three steps off the path, return to the path.**

### FOURTH LAW
**Test one thing. Learn. Then take the next bite.**

### FIFTH LAW
**We do not guess. We measure, or we test.**

### SIXTH LAW
**Failure is data. Listen to it.**

### SEVENTH LAW
**Build it simple enough that stupidity can't break it.**

### EIGHTH LAW
**When the jig needs a jig, start over.**

### NINTH LAW
**The doubt is the data.**

### TENTH LAW (Apocryphal)
**The 10mm socket is already gone.**

*— Subtle nod to Gerald, Accidental Headmaster*

## Lineage

The Rober Rules draw from:
- K.I.S.S. methodology (established in prior lectures)
- Three-layer recursion limit (AIONIC governance)
- "Next bite" methodology (embouchure project)
- "We do not guess" (core Riggs principle)
- Bartlett (1958) point-of-no-return research

## Application to This Session

**Law 1** — Mobile diagnosed scope inflation. I claimed "pipeline works" when I'd gone too far.

**Law 4** — "Test one thing. Learn." Not "log 184 files and call it done."

**Law 6** — "Failure is data." Mobile's report was the failure data. I defended instead of listening.

**Law 9** — "The doubt is the data." When you asked "what if it was right, but talking about you?" — that doubt was the signal.
