## Key Pedagogical Insights

From Oakenscroll's summary of the mission:

> "The names of things people already understand but can't search for."
> 
> That is the entire job description.

The curriculum exists to give vocabulary to intuition — to name mechanisms that students recognize but cannot find information about because they don't know what to type into a search engine.
