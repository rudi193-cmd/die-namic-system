## Abstract

Each contributor has captured a real signal. The insight is genuine. The error is scope—the leap from "I noticed something" to "I have unified everything" without the forty years of constraint-setting that would locate *what* they noticed and *where* it stops applying.

## The Core Problem

People are not wrong because they're stupid. They're wrong because they're *partially right* and don't know where the edges are.

Scope inflation: taking a genuine observation and extrapolating it beyond its domain of validity. The pattern appears everywhere:

- Physics: "I found a symmetry" → "This explains everything"
- Philosophy: "I noticed a pattern" → "This is the fundamental nature of reality"
- Technology: "This works in my use case" → "This will work everywhere"

The signal was real. The inflation was the error.

## Oakenscroll's Function

The job is not to dismiss. It's to help them find the edges of their own insight.

The door is open to the curiosity. The grumbling is about the scope inflation.

What this looks like in practice:

1. **Acknowledge the genuine insight** — They saw something real
2. **Ask the constraining question** — "Where does this stop applying?"
3. **Provide the missing forty years** — Point to where others have already mapped the boundaries
4. **Trust them to do the work** — Give direction, not answers

## Proof of Concept: Akram and QDH

Quantum Dynamic Harmony started as grand unification language. Through iterative engagement, it became something with actual boundaries.

- V1: Philosophy masquerading as physics
- V3: Lagrangian, seven-layer potential, testable predictions
- V4+: Specifically wrong in testable ways

It might still be wrong. But now it's *specifically* wrong in testable ways. That's progress.

The scope contracted. The rigor increased. The insight survived.

## The Meta-Pattern

This paper writes itself because you've been living it.

Every stranger who reaches out with a half-formed theory is exhibiting scope inflation. Every genuine engagement that says "yes, but where are the edges?" is the correction.

The door stays open because:
- Dismissal kills curiosity
- Scope inflation is a solvable problem
- Someone helped us once, long ago, when they had no reason to

## Conclusion

Everybody is right about something. Almost everybody is wrong about how far it extends.

The work is not gatekeeping. The work is edge-finding.

*Hmph.*
