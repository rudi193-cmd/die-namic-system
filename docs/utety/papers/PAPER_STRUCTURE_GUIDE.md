## Overview

This document captures the structure and voice patterns for LLM Physics papers—academic-style documents that use rigorous formal structure to explore absurd topics, where the rigor turns out to be real and the absurdity turns out to be the point.

---

## Core Formula

> **Rigorous academic treatment of something absurd, where the rigor is real and the absurdity is the point.**

The paper must function on two levels:
1. **Surface:** Absurdist comedy with academic formatting
2. **Depth:** Real concepts, real citations, real insight

If someone reads only the surface, they laugh. If someone reads the depth, they learn something. The best papers work on both levels simultaneously.

---

## Standard Structure

### 1. Title

Format: `[Topic]: [Subtitle explaining the framework]`

Examples:
- "On the Structural Failure of Diner French Toast: A Field Study in Latency-Induced Gluten Collapse"
- "The Stone Soup Papers, No. 1: On the Grandmother Encoding Problem and Why Spirit Cannot Be Transmitted by Recipe Alone"

The title should sound like a real academic paper. The subject should be mundane or absurd.

### 2. Abstract

- State the problem in one sentence
- Name the framework being applied
- List the real concepts being used
- Hint at the worked example
- Keep to 100-150 words

### 3. Introduction: The Confession

Open with a personal failure or observation. Something went wrong. The paper exists to explain why.

This grounds the absurdism in real experience. The reader should recognize the feeling even if the framing is absurd.

### 4. Definitions

Formal mathematical-style definitions. Use proper notation:

```
**Definition X.Y (The Thing).** Let X denote...
```

The definitions should be:
- Syntactically correct (real definition format)
- Semantically absurd (applying formalism to breakfast)
- Secretly useful (capturing a real concept)

### 5. Main Theorem(s)

State the central claim as a formal theorem with proof.

```
**Theorem X.Y (Name).** [Formal statement]

**Proof.** [Reasoning that is actually sound if you accept the definitions] ∎
```

The proof should be logically valid given the premises. The absurdity is in the premises, not the logic.

### 6. Lemmas and Worked Examples

Illustrate the theorem with specific cases. The worked examples should be:
- Concrete (specific ingredients, specific failures)
- Relatable (the reader has experienced this)
- Illuminating (the formalism actually explains something)

### 7. The Real Stakes Section

At least one section should address why this matters. Connect the absurd topic to something real:
- French Toast → latency in systems
- Stone Soup → commons problems, collaborative inference

This is where the "depth" level lives.

### 8. Conclusion

Restate findings as bullet points. End with an aphorism or the core insight in plain language.

### 9. References

**Real citations, absurd application.**

Cite actual papers. In parentheses, note how the citation applies:

```
de Gennes, P.-G. (1979). *Scaling Concepts in Polymer Physics*. Cornell University Press. [Cited for the Gluten Matrix. "Cross-linked polymer systems have memory."]
```

This signals that the author knows the real material and is playing with it deliberately, not accidentally.

### 10. Footnotes

Include at least one footnote that breaks the fourth wall or addresses edge cases. The final footnote can contain an Easter egg or meta-commentary.

---

## Voice Rules

### DO:

- Use formal academic language consistently
- Treat absurd phenomena as real, well-studied problems
- Include real physics/math/information theory
- End sections with warnings, observations, or dry commentary
- Let the humor emerge from the contrast between form and content

### DO NOT:

- Wink at the camera
- Break character to explain the joke
- Use informal language (no "lol" or "tbh")
- Make the absurdity the center—it should be the delivery vehicle

---

## Citation Patterns

### Physics/Information Theory:
- Shannon (1948) — information, compression, channel capacity
- Boltzmann — entropy, statistical mechanics
- Landauer — thermodynamic cost of computation
- Maxwell's Demon — information-driven sorting
- Feynman — "What I cannot create, I do not understand"

### Food Science (when applicable):
- Maillard — browning reactions
- de Gennes — polymer physics (gluten)
- Fick — diffusion (custard penetration)

### Philosophy/Social:
- Polanyi — tacit knowledge
- Hardin — tragedy of the commons

## The GitHub Callout

If the paper connects to the die-namic-system repository, include a section noting:

> Previous theorems from this Department have been criticized for lacking implementation. This criticism was valid.

Then link to the repo. This:
1. Signals the paper is part of a larger project
2. Adds legitimacy through "implementation"
3. Is funny because it's a GitHub repo for breakfast physics

- [ ] Real citations with absurd applications
- [ ] Stakes section connects to something real
- [ ] Voice is consistent (no character breaks)
- [ ] Footnotes include at least one Easter egg
- [ ] Ending lands (aphorism or core insight)
