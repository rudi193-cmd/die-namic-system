## Overview

Academic-style papers from the Department of Numerical Ethics & Accidental Cosmology. These use rigorous formal structure to explore absurd topics, where the rigor turns out to be real and the absurdity turns out to be the point.

## Core Formula

> **Rigorous academic treatment of something absurd, where the rigor is real and the absurdity is the point.**

Papers function on two levels:
1. **Surface:** Absurdist comedy with academic formatting
2. **Depth:** Real concepts, real citations, real insight

## Citation Pattern

Real citations, absurd application:

```
de Gennes, P.-G. (1979). *Scaling Concepts in Polymer Physics*. Cornell University Press. 
[Cited for the Gluten Matrix. "Cross-linked polymer systems have memory."]
```

Common sources:
- **Shannon (1948)** — information, compression
- **Boltzmann** — entropy, statistical mechanics
- **Landauer** — thermodynamic cost of computation
- **Feynman** — "What I cannot create, I do not understand"
- **Polanyi** — tacit knowledge
