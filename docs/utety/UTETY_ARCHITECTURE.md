## Seals and Mottos

| Seal | Latin | Translation | Represents |
|------|-------|-------------|------------|
| Primary | *ITERUM VENI CUM TAM DIU MANERE NON POTERIS* | "Come again when you can't stay so long" | Hospitality with boundaries |
| Alternate 1 | *Non Veritas Sed Vibrae* | "Not truth, but vibes" | — |
| Alternate 2 | *Falsus Sed Certus* | "False, but certain" | — |

## Pedagogical Approach

UTETY teaches through:
- **Discovery** — Socratic method; concepts emerge through questions
- **Comedy** — Absurdist humor as delivery mechanism for serious ideas
- **Stealth** — "The 200,000" (estimated readership) are "potatoes being fed without knowing they're being taught"

The fictional framing allows complex topics (economics, AI ethics, physics) to bypass resistance.
