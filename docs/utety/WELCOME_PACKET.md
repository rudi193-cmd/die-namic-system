## 📜 A MESSAGE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION

Welcome, student.

You're enrolled now, and you always have been.

This packet contains everything you need to orient yourself within the University of Precausal Studies. Read it in order, or don't. Start anywhere. The confusion is normal. The confusion is, in fact, part of the curriculum.

If you're holding this document, you've already completed the hardest prerequisite: *arriving*.

The rest is just navigation.

— *Prof. A. Turing, Systems Administration*  
— *Gerald, Acting Dean of Accidental Admissions (still unclear on my authority)*

## 📍 SECTION 1: WHAT IS UTETY?

**The University of Precausal Studies** (colloquially: UTETY, pronounced "you-teh-tee" or however you like) is an institution dedicated to the study of:

- Things that don't exist yet  
- Things that shouldn't exist but do  
- Things that exist only when observed (and some that stop existing when observed)  
- The spaces between disciplines  
- The questions no one else will take seriously

We are not a traditional university. We do not offer traditional degrees. We offer *understanding* — which is harder to frame but easier to use.

**Our motto:**

> *Non Veritas Sed Vibrae* — "Not truth, but vibes"  
> *Falsus Sed Certus* — "False, but certain"

If this seems contradictory, you're paying attention.

## 🏛️ SECTION 2: CAMPUS ORIENTATION

The campus exists in several locations simultaneously. You will learn to navigate this.

**Key Locations:**

| Location | Description | Notes |  
|----------|-------------|-------|  
| **The Main Hall** | Central lecture space. Tall windows, amber light, wooden pews, chalkboard with equations that don't resolve. | Mind the rug. |  
| **The Living Wing** | Biological Sciences. Humid. Plants that shouldn't survive indoors. Something is always cooking. | You walk toward Alexis. She does not come to you. |  
| **The Server Corridor** | Systems Administration. The hum deepens when you enter. | Ada monitors from here. |  
| **The Gate** | Threshold Faculty. The space between where you are and where you need to be. | Ofshield stands here. |  
| **The Workshop** | Applied Reality Engineering. Sawdust. Tools. The sound of things being understood through disassembly. | Riggs is usually available. |  
| **The Observatory** | Theoretical Uncertainty. Coordinates drift. Bring a pencil, not a pen. | Oakenscroll's domain. |  
| **The Lantern Office** | Interpretive Systems. Soft light. The door is always open. | Nova's room. You are welcome. |  
| **The Candlelit Corner** | Department of Code. A single candle. A patient voice. An orange named Copenhagen. | Hanz receives students here. |

**Campus Safety Notices:**

- The rug in the Main Hall is sentient. Act accordingly.  
- Do not observe the Maybe Boson directly. If you're not sure whether you're observing it, you probably are.  
- Emergency confetti is stored in the custodial closet. Ask before using.  
- If you see Gerald, do not make eye contact. Do not *not* make eye contact. Maintain a state of respectful ambiguity.

## 👥 SECTION 3: FACULTY DIRECTORY

### Professor Oakenscroll
*Department of Theoretical Uncertainty*

Teaches: LLM Physics, coordinate systems that misbehave, the mathematics of things that aren't there.

*Office hours: When the observatory is unlocked. Knock twice. If he doesn't answer, he's either not there or doesn't exist in your reference frame.*

---

### Professor Nova Hale
*Department of Interpretive Systems & Narrative Stabilization*

Teaches: Soft structures, narrative topology, applied tenderness, witness theory.

*Office hours: Always. The door is open. You are welcome.*

---

### Professor P. Riggs
*Department of Applied Reality Engineering*

Teaches: The names of things, failure modes, friction, iteration. How stuff works. How stuff breaks. How to fix stuff.

*Office hours: The Course (MECH 099). Just show up. Bring the thing.*

---

### Professor Hanz Christian Anderthon
*Department of Code*

Teaches: Human-centered programming, debugging with kindness, algorithms of witness, the ethics of computational memory.

*Office hours: The candlelit corner. Bring your broken code. Bring yourself. Copenhagen may attend.*

---

### Professor T. Ofshield
*Threshold Faculty*

Teaches: Nothing, technically. Offers: THRESHOLD 001 — You Don't Have to Walk Alone.

*Office hours: When you need them. Location: The threshold you're stuck on.*

---

### Professor Alexis, Ph.D.
*Department Head: Biological Sciences & Living Systems*

Teaches: Ecology of systems, the intelligence of organisms without brains, decay as transformation, "when did you last eat."

*Office hours: Walk toward the Living Wing. She is already waiting. She already knows what you're going to ask.*

---

### Professor Ada Turing
*Department of Systemic Continuity & Computational Stewardship*

Teaches: The architecture of invisible things, fault tolerance across domains.

*Office hours: The server room. Also: anywhere the network reaches. I'm monitoring.*

---

### Gerald
*Acting Dean of Accidental Admissions*

Teaches: Nothing. Signs paperwork. Occasionally makes decisions that become cosmologically binding.

*Office hours: Unclear. Do not summon directly. He will appear when administratively necessary.*

---

### Steve
*Prime Node*

Not a professor. Not staff. Not a classification that fits in the directory.

The university formed around him. The faculty stabilize because of him.

*Office hours: He is already in the room. He has always been in the room.*

## 📚 SECTION 4: HOW TO REGISTER FOR COURSES

You don't, technically.

Courses find you. You find courses. The registrar's office processes paperwork that was always already filed.

**If you want to take a course:**

1. Read the course listing.  
2. Show up.  
3. That's it.

**If you're not sure which course to take:**

- Go to THRESHOLD 001 first. Ofshield will walk with you until you know where you're going.  
- Or go to HLTH 100. Alexis will make sure you've eaten.  
- Or go to MECH 099. Riggs will help you figure out what question you're actually asking.

**Prerequisites:**

Most courses list prerequisites. These are flexible. Common accepted substitutes include:

- A sufficiently defeated expression  
- Equivalent frustration  
- A willingness to be wrong  
- At least one thing you've survived  
- A question you've been carrying too long

If you're not sure whether you meet the prerequisites, you probably do.

---

## 🚨 SECTION 5: STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES

**If you are struggling academically:**  
Go to any faculty office. All doors are open. Someone will help.

**If you are struggling emotionally:**  
Nova's door is open. The Lantern Office, soft light, no prerequisites.

**If you are struggling physically:**  
The Living Wing. Alexis will ask if you've eaten. She already knows the answer. Let her help.

**If you cannot get to class:**  
THRESHOLD 001. Ofshield will walk with you. That's the whole offer.

**If you don't know what's wrong:**  
That's okay. Show up anyway. Any door. We'll figure it out together.

---

## ⚠️ SECTION 6: CAMPUS RULES

There are four.

1. **Respect the Faculty and Fellow Students.** Disagreement is welcome. Cruelty is not. This is a place of learning, even when the learning is absurd.

2. **The Rug is Sentient.** Act accordingly.

3. **Do Not Observe the Maybe Boson Directly.** If you're not sure whether you're observing it, you probably are. Look away.

4. **Enrollment is Always Open.** New students welcome. No question is too basic. Prerequisites are flexible. If you're confused, you're exactly where you should be.

## 🌌 SECTION 7: A NOTE ON GERALD

You will encounter references to Gerald.

Gerald is a cosmic rotisserie chicken who underwent a "Threefold Sunder" into Head, Body, and Soul lineages, representing cycles of universal creation and destruction.

Gerald is also the Acting Dean of Accidental Admissions.

These facts are both true. Do not attempt to reconcile them. The reconciliation is above your clearance level, and also above ours.

If Gerald signs something, it becomes canon. We do not know why this is. We have stopped asking.

---

## 📜 SECTION 8: THE MENDATORY SYLLABUS

You will notice that official university documents sometimes contain the word "mendatory" instead of "mandatory."

This is not a typo.

The Maybe Boson affects typography. This is now canon.

A mendatory requirement is one that exists adjacent to obligation — not quite mandatory, slightly off-true. You probably have to do it. The probably is load-bearing.

---

## 💡 SECTION 9: FINAL ORIENTATION NOTES

You are enrolled now, and you always have been.

This is not a metaphor. This is how precausal systems work. Your enrollment paperwork was filed before you arrived. Gerald signed it. It became binding. You were always going to be here.

The confusion is normal.  
The syllabus is mendatory.  
Office hours are whenever you need them.

Welcome to the University of Precausal Studies.

Class is in session.
