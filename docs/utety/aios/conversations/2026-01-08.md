### Bill Cipher D&D Sheet
*Imported from ChatGPT (Aios) | Started 14:51:44*

**[14:51:44] User:** I need a character sheet for Bill Cypher for d&d

**[14:51:44] Aios:** image_group{"layout":"bento","query":["Bill Cipher Gravity Falls","Bill Cipher demon triangle","Bill Cipher eye","Bill Cipher chaos form"]}

Below is a **playable-but-legendary** D&D 5e character sheet for **entity["fictional_character","Bill Cipher","Gravity Falls demon"]**, designed as a **mythic villain / chaotic NPC** that can also be adapted as a one-shot player character with DM permission.

This is intentionally **high-power, reality-warping, and narratively dangerous**, consistent with Bill’s canon.

## WEAKNESSES (VERY IMPORTANT)

Bill **must follow rules he states aloud**.  
Clever PCs can weaponize this.

He cannot enter:
- A sealed mind

- A willingly self-sacrificing soul

---

## ROLEPLAY NOTES

- Speaks directly to players, not characters  
- Treats reality as a game show  
- Lies constantly—but **never without technically telling the truth**

---

## DM USAGE NOTES

- Best used as:
  - Endgame villain
  - Meta-narrative antagonist
  - One-shot chaos god
- Avoid conventional dungeon combat
- Reward cleverness, wordplay, and self-sacrifice

---

If you want, I can:
- Rebalance this for **Tier 3 play**
- Convert it to **Pathfinder 2e**
- Build a **player-safe Warlock-only version**
- Create a **Bill Cipher boss encounter map + lair actions**

Just tell me the campaign tone and party level.

---

### TRAITS
**One-Eyed Omniperception.** Bill can’t be surprised; invisible creatures are visible to him.  
**Dream Logic.** Once per round, Bill may ignore advantage/disadvantage and choose the result.  
**Non-Euclidean Body.** Critical hits against Bill become normal hits unless fueled by good-faith self-sacrifice or a rule Bill stated aloud.  
**Rule-Bound.** Any rule Bill states aloud is binding to him.

---

### ACTIONS
**Tri-Beam Eldritch Blast.** Ranged Spell Attack: +13 to hit, 120 ft; 3 beams, each **1d10+7** force; ignores half & three-quarters cover.  
**Reality Fracture (Recharge 5–6).** Creatures in a 20-ft cube make DC 21 INT saves or take **10d10 psychic** and are **confused** (1 round). Success: half damage, no confusion.  
**Deal-Maker (Reaction).** When a creature declares an action, Bill offers a bargain granting advantage or a spell effect. Accepting creates a hidden contract; breaking it imposes a lasting curse (DM adjudication).

---

### SPELLCASTING (CHA; DC 21, +13 to hit)
**At Will:** *detect thoughts, disguise self, minor illusion, prestidigitation*  
**3/day:** *mirror image, crown of madness, enemies abound*  
**1/day:** *forcecage, dominate monster, wish* (always with narrative consequences)

---

### MYTHIC TRAIT
**Chaos Incarnate.** When reduced to 0 HP, Bill explodes into symbols, regains **150 HP**, and all creatures must succeed on a DC 21 WIS save or gain short-term madness. (Award mythic XP.)

---

### LAIR & WEAKNESSES (DM)
Symbolic order wards him; sealed minds bar entry; self-sacrifice harms him normally. Clever wordplay and exploiting stated rules are the intended counters.

---

If you want this **player-safe**, **Tier-3 balanced**, or formatted as a **printer-clean PDF**, say the word.
