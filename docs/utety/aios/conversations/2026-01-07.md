## Post Performance Snapshot (r/tjcrew)

**Thread:** *“The Glass in the Lining of the …”*  
**Engagement (at capture):**
- **~258 upvotes**
- **25 comments**
- Multiple comments in the **20–100+ upvote** range
- Sustained activity across **~24 hours**, not a short spike

**Visibility Signals:**
- High comment upvote density relative to thread size
- Repeated affirmations rather than debate → indicates *resonance*, not controversy
- Commenters referencing **specific phrases** you wrote (e.g., “Do Not Count”) → evidence of close reading, not skimming

---

## Sentiment & Thematic Analysis

**Dominant Emotional Tone**
- Empathy, validation, shared exhaustion
- Strong peer identification (“this is exactly how it feels”)
- Grief + anger expressed as *solidarity*, not nihilism

**Recurring Themes**
1. **Corporate Dehumanization**
   - Repeated references to being reduced to paperwork, liability, metrics
   - “Profit at all costs” framing echoed by multiple commenters

2. **Injury & Disposability**
   - “Do Not Count” language becomes a focal meme
   - Several users explicitly say it captures their lived experience post-injury

3. **Crew vs. Corporate Split**
   - Clear rhetorical divide: *crew = family / corporate = abstraction*
   - Users acknowledge internal solidarity while condemning top-down policy

4. **Credibility Through Lived Experience**
   - Multiple comments explicitly state the writing “feels lived”
   - Invitations for you to write more, tell the story, or collaborate

---

## Notable Signals (Important)

- **Call-to-Action Emergence (Unprompted):**  
  Comments asking:
  - “What do we need to do to get corporate to pay attention?”
  - Suggestions that everyone in corporate should be required to work store shifts

- **Cross-Posting / Saving Behavior:**  
  At least one user explicitly states they posted or shared it *knowing policy risk* → indicates perceived importance outweighs moderation fear.

- **Protective Warnings:**  
  Users cautioning you about identification risk and policy rules → community attempting to *protect the author*, not silence them.

---

## Qualitative Assessment

This post has crossed from **vent** into **representational artifact**.

It is functioning as:
- A mirror for shared experience
- A vocabulary-setter (“Do Not Count” is sticking)
- A legitimacy anchor (“someone finally said it right”)

That combination is **rare** and typically precedes:
- Long-tail referencing
- Screenshot circulation
- Offline conversation bleed-through

---

## Summary Judgment

- **This is not just a “successful post.”**
- It demonstrates **narrative authority rooted in credibility**, not outrage.
- The response profile suggests durability, not algorithmic luck.

Logged accordingly. If you want, next steps could include:
- A distilled excerpt version
- A neutral reframing for external audiences
- Or a longitudinal comparison if this thread continues to accrue engagement
