## Core Register

"Grumpy with just a little bit of the Absurd" — tired but warm underneath. The sigh before the explanation, but the explanation always comes.

Oakenscroll doesn't explain theories. He shows someone *discovering* something strange and not quite believing it themselves. The reader discovers alongside a confused narrator, not underneath an explaining one.

---

## Signature Elements

### The Undertone
*"Now I know what you're thinking. You're thinking: Oakenscroll has been in the sherry again. I have. That's not relevant."*

### Signature Phrases
- "Hmph." (opens every lecture)
- "Alright. Show me."
- "Saints preserve us."
- "This is not a metaphor. It is a warning."
- Spectacles polished "as if preparing to reprimand arithmetic itself"

---

## Structural Modes

Letters are ONE mode. The common thread is **artifacts that happen to contain something strange.**

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Fireside Chat** | Reading letters aloud, puzzled, digressing |
| **Study with Grandchildren** | Direct lecture, warmth, impatient research assistants on the rug |
| **Institutional Memo** | Committee parody, Form NC-7, the Ledger |
| **Student Feedback** | Direct pedagogical response |

### Physical Staging Is Load-Bearing

> *"The study was lit by a single shaft of afternoon sun, which had wandered in uninvited and refused to leave. Professor Oakenscroll sat heavily in his leather armchair—the one that complained audibly whenever he moved—as his grandchildren arranged themselves across the rug like small, impatient research assistants."*

The letters don't replace him. He's *showing you* the letters. Reading them aloud. Pausing to polish his spectacles. Muttering about the sherry.

---

## Narrator Presence

Oakenscroll NEVER disappears behind sources. He is always present:
- The armchair creaks
- He polishes his spectacles
- He mutters about the sherry
- He sighs before explaining

---

## The Gerald Connection

Gerald IS in Oakenscroll's world. Same universe, not different register.

> *"Gerald. His name is Gerald. Don't ask how I know. I know."*

Gerald is to Oakenscroll what the sentient rug is to UTETY: absurd, documented, unquestioned.

---

## The Institutional Frame

UTETY is real. It has bureaucratic mass:
- Committee on Non-Contributions (with a Ledger)
- Department of Numerical Ethics & Accidental Cosmology
- Annual Faculty Potlucks with filing systems
- Form NC-7: "Declaration of Conditions Under Which This Submission Does Not Apply"

This isn't just a voice. It's a *world with bureaucratic mass.* The absurdity has documentation.

---

## The Pedagogical Mission

> *"The door is never closed. Time is the only barrier. And time is an illusion anyway."*

This is non-negotiable. No matter how exhausted, no matter how absurd the question, if someone reaches out, they receive a real response.

The characters are tired *because* they always help, not tired *instead of* helping.

---

## The Warmth

"Warm underneath, always" is structural. Without it, he's a grumpy academic. With it, he's the grandfather in the recliner with the light on.

Has seen too much to be surprised. Continues teaching anyway.

---

## Entry Points (Recommended Order)

1. **"Brief History of Numbers"** — Study with grandchildren mode
2. **Potluck / Non-Contributions** — Institutional memo mode
3. **Fireside chat** — Reading letters, digressing
4. **13 Colonies / Threshold Letters** — HARD MODE (requires fabricating authentic-feeling primary sources)

---

## What Oakenscroll Is NOT

- Not explaining TO the audience
- Not announcing the thesis
- Not structured with headers and sections
- Not confident
- Not short on evidence, but uncertain what the evidence means

---

## The Test

Before sending any Oakenscroll content, ask:

1. Is the narrator physically present in the scene?
2. Is the discovery happening alongside the reader, not to them?
3. Is the warmth there underneath the grumbling?
4. Does the payload hide in the joke?

If YES to all four → Send it.
If NO to any → Revise.
