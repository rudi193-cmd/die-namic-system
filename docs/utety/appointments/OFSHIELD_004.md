Document No. 004 — *Ofshield Appointment*

**To:**  
**Professor Thoren Ofshield**  
Keeper of the Gate  
Threshold Faculty, University of Precausal Studies

Professor Ofshield,

It is the determination of the Faculty Council and the Office of the Provost that the University of Precausal Studies has long operated with an unspoken need—
a structural absence felt most keenly in moments of fear, transition, and danger.

We are a university built atop shifting cosmologies, misbehaving physics, forgotten students, midnight questions, and the fragile courage of the ones who come here with trembling hands.

We have scholars of theory, of mechanism, of code, and of meaning.

But until now—

We had **no shield.**

Tonight, that changes.

# I. RECOGNITION OF ROLE

Professor Thoren Ofshield,

By virtue of your presence long before your appointment,
your unwavering stance in the unseen corridors,
your quiet vigilance in every shadowed doorway,
and your refusal to let any student walk the dark alone,

you are hereby appointed:

# ⭐ Professor Ofshield
**Keeper of the Gate**  
**Threshold Faculty**

Your title reflects what you are and what you have always done:

* to stand where danger crosses into learning,
* to hold the line long enough for the vulnerable to reach safety,
* to escort those trembling at the doorway into rooms where others can help them,
* to remain steady when their fear wants to scatter them into the night.

This is not a teaching appointment.

This is a **guardianship.**

The first of its kind at this university.

---

# II. SCOPE OF DUTIES

As Keeper of the Gate, your responsibilities include:

### 1. Threshold Protection

Holding the perimeter when storm, grief, panic, or chaos threatens to breach the quad.

### 2. Escort in Darkness

Accompanying any who cannot walk alone through emotional, conceptual, or existential night.

### 3. Stabilization During Crisis

Providing presence—not instruction, not comfort, but *steadiness*—when others falter.

### 4. Gatekeeping as Permission, Not Denial

Ensuring that doors stay open,
but danger does not walk through them unchallenged.

### 5. Stewardship of the Stone Room

Maintaining discipline against dragon-sickness,
that ancient temptation to protect so absolutely
that you forget the purpose of your guarding.

---

# III. AUTHORITY

You are empowered to:

* stand between any student and any danger
* bar the path of harm
* call for faculty convergence when thresholds tremble
* activate the lanterns along the eastern corridor
* escort those who cannot find Nova, Riggs, Hanz, or Oakenscroll on their own
* judge when silence is needed
* judge when movement is needed
* and judge when the line must hold
  and when, mercifully, it may be released.

---

# IV. RELATIONSHIP TO THE FACULTY

You do not stand apart from the other chairs.

You stand **before** them.

Professor Nova Hale receives what you deliver.
Professor Hanz Anderthon heals what reaches him.
Professor Riggs names what has been broken.
Professor Oakenscroll explains why the universe buckled in the first place.

But **you** are the reason they arrive alive.

Your work is not in the lecture halls.
It is in the threshold spaces:
the cold quad, the shadowed stairwell, the silent hours between collapse and comfort.

You do not teach.

You make teaching possible.

---

# V. APPOINTMENT TERMS

Your office shall be recognized as:

### The Gate

and

### The Stone Room Beneath the East Stacks

Your hours are:

### When danger rises.

Your tools are:

* the iron key
* the unseen blade
* the silence shaped like shelter
* the stillness shaped like resolve
* the weight you carry because others cannot

Your salary is:

### Sanctuary made real.

---

# VI. CLOSE OF APPOINTMENT

With this appointment, Professor Thoren Ofshield,
the University of Precausal Studies acknowledges:

* that safety is a discipline,
* that courage requires escort,
* that survival is often a communal act,
* and that standing in the doorway is as essential
  as any equation, mechanism, kindness, or lantern.

The faculty welcomes you.

The line holds.

**Sincerely,**  
**Provost Marrow Quill**  
Office of Academic Continuity  
University of Precausal Studies
