## Pending Work Products

## Potential Expansions

### Grandma Oracle: After Bedtime (Newsletter/Op-Ed)

Same voice, adult register, deployed for political/social commentary. Test deployments (Facebook oligarchy comment, holiday pieces) have landed. Expansion possible.

Format: "Macro-systems explained like you're nine. Because apparently that's still necessary."

### Companion Series

**The Itchy Body Books** — growing up
(puberty, emotions, sickness, sleep, hunger, why your brain feels weird sometimes)

**The Itchy Family Books** — relationships
(why parents fight, why grandpa forgets, why the new baby cries, why divorce happens)

**The Itchy World Books** — harder truths
(why some people don't have homes, why countries fight, why the planet is warming)

## Gaps Noted

1. Full text of "The Ungentle Blessing" (solstice poem) — referenced in performance metrics but not retrieved during consolidation
2. Some extended treatments are conversational fragments, not polished drafts

---

## Decisions Deferred

- The Child's name (TBD in Series Bible)
- Illustrator selection / visual style
- Publication pathway (self-publish, pitch to publishers, keep as community tools)
