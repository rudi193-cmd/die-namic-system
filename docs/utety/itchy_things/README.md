## Overview

A children's mythology series where Grandma Oracle explains why different parts of the world "itch" — using soft, mythic stories that reveal how things grow, change, tangle, and can be repaired.

**Core Concept:** Itch = friction between what something IS and what it's being ASKED to be

**Repair Philosophy:** "A little stitch never hurts."

**Voice:** Professor Nova Hale / Grandma Oracle (same person, different registers)
