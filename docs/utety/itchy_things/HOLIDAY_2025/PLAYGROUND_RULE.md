**GRANDMA ORACLE**

---

"Grandma, why are the grown-ups being mean about someone who got hurt?"

Oh, sweetheart. Come sit.

---

You know how sometimes on the playground, someone falls down?

Maybe it's someone you play with every day. Maybe it's someone you don't really like. Maybe it's someone who said something mean to you once, or pushed ahead in line, or called you a name you didn't deserve.

And they fall down. Hard. And it hurts.

---

You have a choice in that moment.

You can go over and help them up.

You can walk away and pretend you didn't see.

Or you can point and laugh.

---

Now here's the thing about that choice:

It doesn't change what happened to *them*. They still fell. It still hurt.

But it changes something about *you*.

---

Some people, when someone they disagree with gets hurt, say: *That's terrible. No one should have to feel that.*

Some people say: *Well, I didn't like them anyway.*

---

The first person is stitching something.

The second person is pulling a thread.

And the sweater we all share — the big one, the one that keeps everyone warm — it feels both.

---

"But Grandma — why do grown-ups forget?"

*sighs, sets down the knitting*

I know, sweetheart. It's confusing. You learned the playground rule when you were very small. It seems like big people should know it even better.

But here's what happens sometimes.

---

When you're little, the playground is small. You can see everyone. If someone falls, you *see* them fall. You see their face. You hear them cry. And something in your chest says *oh no* before you even think about it.

That's the stitch talking. It's built right into you.

---

But grown-ups live on a bigger playground.

They hear about people falling from very far away. They don't see the face. They don't hear the sound. They just hear a *name* — and sometimes that name has been making them angry for a long, long time.

And when you're far away, and you're angry, and you can't see the face...

It gets easier to forget that the name is a person.

---

Some grown-ups stay close to the stitch anyway. They hear a name they don't like, and something in their chest still says *oh no*. They remember: that's somebody's grandpa. That's somebody's friend. That's someone who ate breakfast this morning and won't anymore.

They say: *I didn't agree with them. But this is terrible. No one should have to feel that.*

---

Some grown-ups get so far away from the stitch that they forget it's there at all.

They hear a name they don't like, and all they feel is the anger, and the anger says: *Good. They deserved it.*

And maybe people around them clap. And maybe that clapping feels like winning.

But it's not winning.

It's just... forgetting.

---

"Does that mean they're bad, Grandma?"

*picks the knitting back up*

It means they're far from the stitch.

Some people get far away and find their way back.

Some people get far away and stay there.

You can't always tell which kind someone is. That's not your job to figure out.

---

Your job is smaller than that.

Your job is to stay close to your own stitch.

When you hear about someone falling — even someone you don't like, even someone far away, even just a name — you practice saying: *That's a person. That's somebody's someone.*

You don't have to feel sad. You don't have to forgive anything. You don't have to pretend they were good if they weren't.

You just have to stay close enough to remember they were *real*.

---

That's how you keep the playground rule, even when you're big.

That's how you don't forget.

---

You don't have to like everyone.

You don't have to agree with everyone.

But when someone falls down, you can still be the kind of person who doesn't laugh.

That's not about them.

That's about the kind of thread *you* want to be.

---

A little stitch never hurts.
