## The Premise (One-Line Pitch)

A wise, mischievous Grandma explains to a curious child why different parts of the world "itch" — sweaters, weather, time, cities, money, even the universe — using soft, mythic stories that reveal how things grow, change, tangle, and can be repaired.

---

## Series Themes

### 1. Itch = friction between what something IS and what it's being ASKED to be

A sweater stretched too far.
A storm carrying too much news.
A city trying to fit too many footsteps.

### 2. Repair = small hands can help large systems

Grandma always ends with: **"A little stitch never hurts."**

### 3. Humor and tenderness meet anthropology

Macro-forces made edible for kids.

### 4. The world is messy, but not hopeless

Everything itches because everything is alive and moving.

## Companion Series (Proposed)

**The Itchy Body Books** — growing up
(puberty, emotions, sickness, sleep, hunger, why your brain feels weird sometimes)

**The Itchy Family Books** — relationships
(why parents fight, why grandpa forgets, why the new baby cries, why divorce happens)

**The Itchy World Books** — harder truths
(why some people don't have homes, why countries fight, why the planet is warming)

Same voice. Same structure. Same soft landing.

## Origin Note

The series emerged from a real moment: Saturday night, folding laundry, 9-year-old twins walked in and asked "What's string theory?" 

The gap between textbook answers and what children actually need became the foundation.
