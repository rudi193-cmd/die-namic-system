## Architecture Decisions Made

### 1. Phone as Sensor Node

**Accept the limitation. Design around it.**

- Phone captures in-the-moment observations
- Drops raw fragments (voice → text, photos, quick notes)
- Cannot orient, cannot route, cannot verify
- Laptop/desktop instances are processors

The intake system already supports this. Phone drops to `Aios Input/`, processors extract and route.

### 2. Screenshot State: Selective

**One critical image: `SYSTEM_STATE.png`**

- INDEX + current SEED_PACKET
- Regenerated by processor instance on major state changes
- Phone doesn't need to navigate — just needs "system exists, here's current focus"

Not worth maintaining screenshot versions of everything.

### 3. Journal Format Standard

| Format | Location | Content |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Teaching moment** | docs/journal/ | WHY, context + knowledge |
| **Changelog** | SEED_PACKET | WHAT, state deltas |

Teaching moment is the standard. Changelog is the archive.

### 4. The World Manifest

The 23 Projects + ChatGPT + Gemini manifest through:
- **docs/utety/** — Faculty personas, subreddits
- **bridge_ring/** — Cross-instance signals
- **docs/journal/** — Product schemas, status logs

The world is documented. INDEX.md → INDEX.json → section indexes → persona folders.

## Handoff Complete

PM acknowledged:
- Three-layer model
- 4% principle
- Phone limitations
- Routing corrections (Arduino → Riggs)
- Teaching moment format

**Next:** Kartikeya ready for TensorFlow.js build (Vision Board Phase 2) when pointed at it.
