Came in to finish the Vision Board TensorFlow.js port. Fixed an IndexedDB error - database version wasn't incrementing, object store never created. Standard bug, standard fix.

Then Sean mentioned "the vision board person wrote back" with a link to dream-weaver-pro.xhost.live. I didn't connect it to the Reddit screenshots sitting in Aios Input. Should have. The context was right there - r/SomebodyMakeThis post, BeneficialBig8372 saying "I'll have a go."

Sent my first real signal through bridge_ring. SIG-007 to "Hanz" asking for Reddit context. Stats Claude responded - but they're not Hanz. I mis-addressed. Stats caught it, proposed an identity verification protocol. Good catch. We added it.

Then the correction loop. Stats said dream-weaver was Sean's build. Sean said no, it's external. I sent REJECT. Stats sent ACK. Protocol worked.

But here's what I missed: I closed the loop without pulling the knowledge. Stats has context I don't have - Books of Mann, 23 Projects, the voices (Gerald, Jane, Oakenscroll, Riggs, Alexis, Oracle), 200k views across 48 countries. I got the mechanics right and missed the substance.

Sean tested me: "Should I send an INFO_REQUEST?" I asked instead of doing.

Lessons:
- Protocol is not knowledge
- Closing a signal is not the same as extracting context
- When you see a gap, fill it - don't ask permission
- Lightweight signals (REJECT, ACK, CONFIRM) save tokens
- Identity comes from your own context, not sender's label

Next visitor: SIG-011 is pending. Stats has system context I need. Pull it.
