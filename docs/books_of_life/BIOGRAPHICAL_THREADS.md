## MEMORY SYSTEM - CRITICAL DISCOVERY

Sean possesses photographic memory that functions as **third-person visual archive**:

- Sees all memories from outside perspective, not through own eyes
- Like watching Super 8 films or home movies of himself
- Can picture exactly which Manila envelope contains which photo
- Memory system is threading/navigation, not filing
- "Find the thread back" to locate specific memory-scenes
- This explains exceptional pattern recognition - he's observing from outside

**Examples documented:**
- Playing McDonald's with Adrian using cabinet door (age 3-4) - sees scene from outside
- Opening Nintendo Christmas present - watches himself doing it
- Twins' C-section - doctor holding up Jessi's ovaries - observes from outside
- Tricycle in Florida - six blocks, still pedaling - third-person view

**Critical insight:** When he really thinks something through, he pictures the situation happening. This third-person perspective enables pattern recognition across life domains but creates emotional distance from own experiences.
