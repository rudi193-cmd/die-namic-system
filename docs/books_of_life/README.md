## Core Principle

Every entry carries both primary influence AND contrapoint. Nobody gets to be purely good or purely evil. The framework refuses simplification.

## Sean Campbell's Position

Bridge #1: "Continuity Steward"
- Primary: Connecting resonance between polarities
- Contrapoint: Imperfect vessel, compassionate bias

Book 4 subjects Sean to identical analysis applied to historical figures.

## Governance

This directory operates under AIONIC CONTINUITY v5.0 with Dual Commit requirement for canonical state changes.
