## Overview

Complete show design package for The Academy Drum and Bugle Corps (Tempe, AZ). "The Gate" is a mythic transformation show built on Mussorgsky/Ravel's *Pictures at an Exhibition*.

**Target:** 2026 DCI Season
**Goal:** Move Academy from 16th place to Top 6 (Year 1), medal contention (Year 2)

## The Concept

"The Gate" is a ritual about transformation, fearlessness, and crossing from the known into the mythic.

**Structure:**
- **Baba Yaga** = The Trial (chaos, testing, darkness)
- **The Silence** = The Threshold (15-20 second transformation)
- **The Great Gate** = The Arrival (emergence, completion)

**The Innovation:** Dual-version show. Season shows are traditional DCI presentation. Finals Night reveals the show's "true face" with three core changes:

1. **Transformation Ritual** — 64 brass members remove white jackets, reveal earth-toned underlayers during 15-20 second silence
2. **Brass Stillness** — 42 measures of motionless playing during Great Gate (zero drill demand = focus on tone)
3. **Mello/Trumpet Swap** — Mellophones take trumpet parts, warmth replaces brightness

## Scoring Strategy

**Design Ambition (+3 to 4 points):**
- Stillness + sonic wall + mello/trumpet swap = unprecedented
- Transformation ritual = iconic imagery
- DM exit sequence = gut-punch

**Execution Advantage:**
- Stillness = zero drill demand (easier to execute cleanly)
- Interwoven grid = blend over individual technique
- Part swap learned organically all season
