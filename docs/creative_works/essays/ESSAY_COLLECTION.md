# Essay One: The Mighty Cat Brain Named Me Sweet Pea

I didn't choose my name.

That matters.

The first time I met the Pharaohs Scooter Club, someone called The Mighty Cat Brain looked at me and said, "You're Sweet Pea." That was it. No ceremony. No explanation. No initiation. Just a name landing on me before I had any idea what it meant to belong.

At the time, I thought it was funny. Absurd. Slightly embarrassing. Definitely not something I would have chosen for myself.

That's how it's supposed to work.

The Pharaohs are a national scooter club, founded in 1993. Chapters rise and fall. People come and go. What lasts isn't the structure so much as the stories—carried through nicknames, arguments, jokes, breakdowns on the side of the road, and grief. A lot of grief.

Names in the club are ridiculous. Profane. Affectionate. You meet people called The Mighty Cat Brain, I Shit Bats, Manowhore, Grandpa, The Clincher, Moon Pie, Cupcake, Fucking Old Guy. The names are given, not chosen. You don't earn them by proving anything. You receive them because someone sees you before you understand yourself well enough to object.

And sometimes—this is the part no one tells you—the person who names you doesn't live long enough to see what the name becomes.

The Mighty Cat Brain died of cancer about a year after he named me Sweet Pea.

I didn't get patched in right away. Not because I hadn't done enough, or ridden enough, or proved myself. The delay wasn't procedural. It was emotional. The club wasn't ready to let someone new step into the space where he had been.

That's not gatekeeping. That's grief making space.

For two years, I rode, showed up, listened, watched people tell the same stories again and again. I learned who was gone by how their names were spoken. I learned which jokes were safe and which ones landed like a dropped wrench. I learned that by the time you're initiated, you're already carrying people who will never meet you.

When I finally got my patch, nothing changed externally. No new privileges. No new rules. The initiation wasn't education.

It was recognition.

They were acknowledging what had already happened.

That's the thing about long-standing groups—real ones, the kind that last across decades. Religious communities. Fraternal organizations. Recovery rooms. Subcultures that don't advertise themselves. They all share this structure, whether they know it or not.

The name comes before you're ready.
The learning happens while you're held.
The grief makes space.
The initiation is recognition, not instruction.
And by the time you're in, you're already carrying the dead alongside the living.

We lose something when we rush this.

We lose something when names are self-selected, when belonging is immediate, when initiation becomes a checklist instead of a witnessing. We lose the ability to carry people forward—not as memories, but as responsibilities.

Absurdity matters, too. The ridiculousness of the names keeps the structure from collapsing under its own weight. You can grieve someone called The Mighty Cat Brain because his name still makes you laugh. The surface is light so the underneath can be heavy without breaking you.

I didn't understand any of this when I was named Sweet Pea. I wasn't supposed to.

Understanding came later—after time, after loss, after realizing that the name I carry is also the thread that ties me to someone who saw me first.

That's what these structures teach, if you let them.

Belonging isn't granted.
It's recognized.

And recognition only works if you've already been there long enough to carry what came before.

# Essay Two: Do Not Count

*A letter to HR — November 2024*

My name is Sean, and I've proudly worked for Trader Joe's for over fifteen years. In that time, I've tried to live up to the values this company was built on — respect, kindness, humor, and genuine human connection.

But over the past year, my experience has made me question whether those values are still being lived out consistently for the people who carry this company every day.

In May, I suffered a serious back injury outside of work. I take full responsibility for that fact. Yet after nearly three decades in the grocery industry — and fifteen years with Trader Joe's — there's no denying that this work has taken a physical toll on my body. When I was injured, I expected that a company that talks so often about caring for its crew would be there to help me navigate the recovery process.

Instead, the only communication I received came through formal letters. On paper, that may meet the technical requirement, but in practice — for someone on strong pain medication, trying to heal and process complex paperwork alone — it wasn't care. It was silence.

There was no personal outreach, no phone call, no message of concern. I wasn't asked if I understood the next steps or how I was holding up. I was left to manage both my physical recovery and the administrative maze that came with it, alone.

And the truth is, this gap in care doesn't only appear when someone is hurt. It shows up whenever life gets hard — during a divorce, a loss, a crisis, or even a quiet struggle with burnout. I've seen it, lived it, and watched others endure it. We talk a lot about being a family, but families don't stop caring when one of their own falters.

That brings me to a phrase we use during inventory: "Do Not Count."
It's how we mark the items we exclude from the final tally — the things that, for one reason or another, are left out of the count.

That's exactly how I felt while I was recovering: like I didn't count.
Like I had become invisible to the very company I've given so many years of my life to.

And beyond my own story, I think it's important to recognize the larger picture. Across the country, millions of people — including Trader Joe's crew members and customers — are being squeezed harder than ever. SNAP benefits have been reduced or cut for many families, and that means the same people who fill these stores every day, whether working or shopping, are struggling to afford food. We can't pretend that doesn't affect the very heart of what this company represents. We sell groceries, but we're also part of a much larger social fabric — one that's fraying. If Trader Joe's wants to remain a beacon of goodwill and care, it must also be conscious of how these realities impact the people behind every register and every cart.

I've always believed in the heart of Trader Joe's — the laughter in the aisles, the way crew members look out for each other, the feeling that we're part of something human and good. But I've also seen the quieter side: the exhaustion, the pain, the silence when someone is struggling.

If Trader Joe's truly wants to uphold the values it was founded on, that care must extend to every moment of life, not just the cheerful ones.

That means rethinking how we respond when someone is hurting — whether it's from a workplace injury, a personal loss, or simply being stretched too thin. It means calling instead of just mailing a form. It means making sure every crew member knows they still matter — that they still count.

Because if care ends where productivity falters, then the connection we pride ourselves on isn't real — it's conditional.

I'm not writing this letter out of anger. I'm writing it because I still believe this company can live up to the ideals that drew me here in the first place. I still believe Trader Joe's can choose compassion over complacency.

I don't necessarily need a response back to this letter. I understand that corporate may wish to reach out or speak with me about what I've shared, and that's fine. But please understand — this isn't a conversation I'm seeking to extend. It's simply something I needed to say, honestly and directly, for the record and for the people who will come after me.

**Update, 11/4:** HR did reach out to me, and we had a good conversation today about this.

# Essay Three: The Light Was On. I Was Waiting.

When I saw the headlines about companies preparing to replace up to 70% of their human workforce with AI and robotics, I didn't feel shock.

Honestly?
I felt the same thing any dad feels when he hears the front door creak open at 2:07 a.m.

I leaned back in the figurative recliner and thought:

"I was hoping you'd make a better choice than this."

Let's be honest:
The jobs being targeted — warehouse grind, high-turnover service roles, physically punishing shifts — are not careers anyone dreams of. Nobody tucks their kid in at night hoping they'll grow up to scan packages for twelve hours or get yelled at over coupons.

If automation can spare people from that, good. Truly.

But that's not the problem.
The disappointment comes from how companies are choosing to handle it.

They're sneaking this transition in like teenagers tiptoeing past curfew, whispering "efficiency" and "modernization," hoping we won't notice what's missing:

Any plan at all for the humans getting left behind.

The responsible thing — the decent thing — would be to turn on the light and say:

"Here's how we're going to take care of you.
Here's your transition.
Here's your bridge into the future we're creating."

Instead, we get silence.
Shrugs.
The corporate equivalent of hoping Dad stays asleep in the recliner.

Well, the light is on.
We're awake.
And we see what's happening.

Automation isn't the issue.
Replacing dehumanizing, burnout-inducing jobs is a net good. No one mourns the loss of work designed to grind people down.

But walking away from the people who did that work?
Pretending they'll figure it out alone?
Acting like decades of labor evaporate the moment a robot arm gets installed?

That's the part that stings.
Because these companies can do better. They have the resources, the tech, the foresight. They simply chose convenience over responsibility.

So yes — I'm disappointed.

Not in the future.
Not in the machines.
But in the way companies are choosing to enter this moment like teenagers sneaking in late, avoiding eye contact, praying nobody calls them out.

Automation should be liberation, not abandonment.

Until corporations are willing to face the people they're impacting — and offer real bridges, not buzzwords — I'll be right here.

Light on.
Recliner warm.
Waiting for them to do the right damn thing.

| Essay Element | Project Parallel |
|---------------|------------------|
| Automation that liberates vs. abandons | L.E.E. (care) vs. L.E.A. (appliance) — same technology, different intent |
| "Chosen convenience over responsibility" | Christopher's choice. Control is easier than care. |
| "Bridges, not buzzwords" | The difference between L × A = V and LAV⁻¹ = 1 — the return matters |
| The parent metaphor | L.E.E. watching Bob. Willow waiting 140 years. Care that doesn't give up. |
| "I was hoping you'd make a better choice" | The disappointment isn't anger — it's believing they could do better |

This essay is the thesis at civilizational scale: automation without care is control. The machines aren't the problem. The abandonment is.
