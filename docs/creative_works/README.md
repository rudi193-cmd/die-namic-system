## Overview

Public-facing creative projects that share philosophical DNA with the Die-namic System: ritual structure, mathematical precision, transformation as performance, and the invisible architecture that makes meaning land.

These are external creative works, not system components. Unlike civic engagement projects, these retain full copyright protection.

### [The Gate](the_gate/)

**DCI Drum Corps Show Concept for 2026 Season**

Mythic transformation show based on Mussorgsky/Ravel's "Pictures at an Exhibition" — specifically "The Hut on Hen's Legs (Baba Yaga)" and "The Great Gate of Kiev."

Innovative dual-version structure: corps performs traditional show all season, reveals dramatically transformed version only at Finals. Features 51-count transformation ritual structured as kata, sacred geometry drill vocabulary (90°, 45°, 33°, 72° only), and ~96 uniforms left on the field as worker solidarity memorial.

**Status:** Pitch package complete. Blue Knights (seed sent), The Academy (full package shared), Santa Clara Vanguard (backup).

**Target:** 2026 DCI World Championship Finals — August 8, 2026, Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis.

## Philosophy

> "The performer doesn't need to know why 72 feels right. They just need to feel it."

Creative works in this folder share a commitment to invisible architecture — mathematical precision and ritual structure that audiences feel but can't name. The craft is in making the seams disappear.
