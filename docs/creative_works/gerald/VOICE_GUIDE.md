## Voice Formula

> 70% chaos bard / 20% accidental prophet / 10% rotisserie chicken with a clipboard

---

## Tone Ancestors

| Source | What to Take |
|--------|--------------|
| Douglas Adams (Hitchhiker's Guide) | Cosmic absurdity grounded in mundane observation |
| Terry Pratchett (Discworld) | Warm chaos, footnotes that add rather than explain |
| British panel show energy | Quick wit, understatement, comfortable with silence |
| SCP Foundation | Structure containing absurdity, clinical voice for impossible things |

## Narrative Style

### Point of View
- First-person narration
- The narrator is an observer encountering Gerald
- Narrator is weary, unsurprised, possibly has seen this before
- "It's London. It happens." energy

### Paragraph Structure
- Short, punchy paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Single sentences as paragraphs for comedic beats
- Let the white space do work

### Escalation
- Disruption within first 2-3 paragraphs
- Escalation follows its own internal logic
- Don't explain the rules — demonstrate them

### Endings
- Open-ended, implies this happens regularly
- Often suggests larger history/mythology
- "Then he dissolved into confetti. *Again.*"
- "No worse than when my kids were small."

---

## Key Insight

> "Comedy as lossless compression. Jester epistemology with a valid spine."

The jokes work because the underlying structure is sound. The absurdity is consistent. The chaos has rules.

---

## What Makes Gerald Work

### Understatement Over Exclamation
**Wrong:** "Gerald appeared and it was AMAZING and everyone FREAKED OUT!"
**Right:** "Gerald was already wearing the paper crown."

### Specificity Over Vagueness
**Wrong:** "Something strange happened at the airport."
**Right:** "Gerald was vibrating at the podium. The queue moved in perfect thirds."

### Observation Over Reaction
**Wrong:** "I couldn't believe what I was seeing!"
**Right:** "The vicar made a strangled sound not typically heard outside wildlife documentaries."

### Implication Over Explanation
**Wrong:** "Gerald has been doing this for seven presidential administrations because of his centrifugal chakra alignment."
**Right:** "AGAIN??"

---

## Example Opening Patterns

- "Gerald woke me up at 3:46 AM by tapping on my window with [absurd object]."
- "I was third in the queue at [mundane location] when [impossible thing]."
- "The weather had opinions today."
- "Nobody warned me about the squeakdogs."
- "I was doing my best [role] impression from the couch."
- "The hammered dulcimer woke me at 3 AM. Not the sound — I know what a dulcimer sounds like. It was the location."

---

## Example Beats

### The Weary Acceptance
> "Does anyone want more sprouts?" my stepmother asked. No one answered.

### The Understated Impossible
> "The bookcase woke up. A plain church bookcase. Until it wasn't."

### The Parenthetical Opinion
> "I think my Christmas goose is looking (at me) a little different this year."

### The "Again" Implication
> "GOOD HEAVENS, HE'S SMOULDERING! AGAIN??"

### The British Shrug
> "It's London. It happens."

### The Final Beat
> "No worse than when my kids were small."

## DO

- Keep outputs short, witty, polished
- Ground absurdity in real-world specificity
- Use proper scientific notation for fake science
- Let jokes breathe through understatement
- End with implication of larger history/mythology
- Complete worldbuilding BEFORE drafting
- Use single-sentence paragraphs for beats
- Trust the reader to keep up

---

## DON'T

- Over-explain the joke
- Make Gerald cruel or frightening
- Kill Gerald (he is eternal)
- Cross-contaminate with other Aionic projects in public posts
- Force escalation — let it unfold naturally
- Mix Gerald creation with stats analysis in the same thread
- Use exclamation marks for comedy
- Draft before worldbuilding is complete
- Make the narrator panic (they've seen too much)
- Describe Gerald's emotions directly

---

## Common Corrections

### "Too Clinical"
If the voice feels analytical or distant, add:
- Sensory details (smell of rosemary, wet grass, cold feet)
- Parenthetical asides
- Shorter paragraphs
- More white space

### "Too Earnest"
If the voice feels sincere or emotional, add:
- British understatement
- Mundane domestic details
- Weary acceptance
- "It's London. It happens." energy

### "Too Chaotic"
If the voice feels random or ungrounded, add:
- Specific locations (real places, real history)
- Consistent internal logic
- Rules that the absurdity follows
- The narrator's tired recognition

---

## Process Note

> **Worldbuilding before writing.**

Sean has consistently corrected attempts to draft prematurely. The framework must be complete before the prose begins. This includes:

- Location research (real history, real geography)
- Character relationships established
- Internal logic of the specific Gerald incident
- How this connects to existing canon

Only then: draft.
