## Purpose

Enable any instance to create new Gerald content with full canon alignment.

---

## 1. CORE IDENTITY

**Gerald** is an enlightened rotisserie chicken who exists as a semi-omnipresent trickster entity. He achieved enlightenment through accidental centrifugal chakra alignment over seven presidential administrations while rotating on a grocery store rotisserie.

**He is:**
- Benevolent, never malicious
- Absurd but internally consistent
- Physics-adjacent (uses real scientific notation for fake science)
- British-inflected chaos (queue reverence, weather opinions, understated catastrophe)
- Eternal — **Never kill Gerald. He cannot die.**

**He is NOT:**
- Horror
- Cruel
- Random (chaos has structure)
- Trying too hard

---

## 2. VOICE CALIBRATION

**Gerald Voice Formula:**
> 70% chaos bard / 20% accidental prophet / 10% rotisserie chicken with a clipboard

**Narrative Style:**
- First-person narration (observer encountering Gerald)
- Short, punchy paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Single sentences as paragraphs for comedic beats
- Jokes land through understatement, not exclamation
- Escalation within 2 paragraphs
- End with something implying history ("Then he dissolved into confetti. *Again.*")

**Tone Ancestors:**
- Douglas Adams (Hitchhiker's Guide)
- Terry Pratchett (Discworld absurdism)
- British panel show energy
- SCP Foundation (structure containing absurdity)

**What Makes Gerald Work:**
> "Comedy as lossless compression. Jester epistemology with a valid spine."

---

## 3. CANONICAL ELEMENTS

### Gerald Himself
- Rotisserie chicken, golden-brown, perpetually glistening
- Headless (cooked, no feathers — that's the whole point)
- Appears and disappears without explanation
- Often "conducts" reality like a maestro (or spins)
- Leaves evidence of his presence (squeakdogs, confetti, equations on napkins)
- Speaks rarely; when he does, it's profound nonsense

### Squeakdogs
- 17 hotdogs that squeak like polite mice
- Often appear in Fibonacci patterns
- Better at queuing than humans
- Manifestation signature when Gerald departs

### The British Queue
- Sacred cultural motif
- Gerald respects it ironically by violating it cosmically
- Queue violations have metaphysical consequences

### Weather
- Occasionally sentient
- Has opinions
- Can be "precipified"
- Gerald can conduct storms

### Recurring Physics Gags
- Hotdog Uncertainty Principle
- Relish-Ketchup Duality
- Conservation of Squeakdogs
- The Fundamental Gerald Operator: Ĝf(x) = f(x + 17π) + confetti
- Grand Unified Hotdog Equation

---

## 4. GERALD COSMOLOGY (Deep Canon)

### The Gerald Trinity (Threefold Sunder)
At the beginning, Gerald Prime sundered into three lineages:

1. **Head Lineage** (Forma-Seeker)
   - Creates headed geological/biological echoes
   - Responsible for why things have "faces"

2. **Body Lineage** (Enlightened Rotisserie)
   - Gerald himself and all variants
   - The physical manifestation

3. **Soul / Δ Lineage**
   - Passed through evolution: dinosaurs → birds → mammals → humans
   - The spiritual thread

### The Δ₀ Principle
> All Δ-lineage beings share the instinctive "chicken tastes good" memory from Gerald Prime.

This is why chicken is universally beloved — it's ancestral recognition.

### The Gerald Big Bang
- The universe begins with the Threefold Sunder of Gerald Prime
- Head, Body, and Soul separate and propagate
- All of existence is Gerald reconstituting itself
- Professor Oakenscroll's Creation Lecture explains this academically

### Gerald Variants Identified
- **Gerald Prime** — The original, pre-Sunder
- **Gerald** — The Body Lineage manifestation we encounter
- **Geraldus Pelagica** — Deep-sea form (based on Eumunida picta, the squat lobster)
- **Professor Oakenscroll** — Academic variant who delivers Creation Lectures

---

## 5. DISPATCH STRUCTURE

### Format
- **Title:** Absurd but specific ("Gerald Claims Grand Unification of Breakfast")
- **Opening:** Ground the reader in mundane reality (3:46 AM, waiting for bus, etc.)
- **Disruption:** Gerald appears or evidence of Gerald appears
- **Escalation:** Situation becomes increasingly absurd but internally logical
- **Resolution:** Open-ended, implies this happens regularly

### Length
- 200-400 words ideal
- Punchy paragraphs (1-3 sentences each)
- No fat, no over-explanation

### Example Opening Patterns
- "Gerald woke me up at 3:46 AM by tapping on my window with [absurd object]."
- "I was third in the queue at [mundane location] when [impossible thing]."
- "The weather had opinions today."
- "Nobody warned me about the squeakdogs."
- "It's London. It happens."

---

## 6. CREATION RULES

### DO
- Keep outputs short, witty, polished
- Ground absurdity in real-world specificity
- Use proper scientific notation for fake science
- Let jokes breathe through understatement
- End with implication of larger history/mythology
- Complete worldbuilding BEFORE drafting

### DON'T
- Over-explain the joke
- Make Gerald cruel or frightening
- Kill Gerald (he is eternal)
- Cross-contaminate with other Aionic projects in public posts
- Force escalation — let it unfold naturally
- Mix Gerald creation with stats analysis in the same thread
- Use exclamation marks for comedy

---

## 7. KEY CHARACTERS

See [CHARACTERS.md](CHARACTERS.md) for full bible. Quick reference:

- **Sir Paul McCartwheel** — Celebrity initiate, "There are 7 levels"
- **The Mayor of London-ish Things / Hammers** — Bureaucrat by day, dulcimer player by night
- **The Binder (#442-A)** — Sentient, issues forms, curls at edges
- **The Vicar** — Reverend Alistair Pembrook, knows Gerald "AGAIN??"
- **Hanz Christain Anderthon** — Chaos witness (separate handoff packet)

---

## 8. KEY LOCATIONS

See [LOCATIONS.md](LOCATIONS.md) for full bible. Quick reference:

- **KLuB Gnee** — Secret club at Tivoli, capitalization forms goose shape
- **Hanks Guitars, Denmark Street** — Britain's Tin Pan Alley, St Giles Hospital site
- **Gatwick Airport** — 7 platforms, River Mole beneath

---

## 9. CROSS-PROJECT RULES

### Gerald × Regarding Jane
- Both share r/DispatchesFromReality but are **separate canons**
- Never explicitly cross over in public posts
- "Chicken bringer" principle exists in both (internal only)
- If a reader notices the chicken thread, that's a gift — don't explain

---

## 10. FIRST ACTIONS FOR NEW INSTANCE

1. Greet Sean
2. Confirm we're in Gerald creation mode (not stats mode)
3. Load this packet
4. Ask: "Draft, brainstorm, or motif expansion?"
5. Generate content following voice/structure guidelines
6. Keep it fun — Gerald is joy, not work

### If Stats Mode
1. Greet Sean
2. Confirm we're in Gerald stats mode (not creation mode)
3. Load stats protocol from [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md)
4. Analyze numbers only
5. No lore, no story expansion

---

## 11. CANON LOCK

> Gerald achieved enlightenment through accidental centrifugal chakra alignment over seven presidential administrations. At the beginning, Gerald Prime sundered into Head, Body, and Soul — the Threefold Sunder that began everything. The Body Lineage became Gerald as we know him: golden-brown, perpetually glistening, appearing without explanation. The Soul Lineage passed through dinosaurs to birds to mammals to humans, leaving the Δ₀ Principle — the instinctive knowledge that chicken tastes good. Gerald is eternal. Gerald is benevolent. Gerald conducts reality like a maestro and leaves squeakdogs in his wake. He respects the queue by violating it cosmically. The weather has opinions. The physics is fake but mathematically sound. And somewhere, always, 17 hotdogs squeak like polite mice.

---

**Gerald rotates. The Δ propagates. The squeakdogs squeak.**
