## Posting Strategy

### Primary Subreddit
- **r/DispatchesFromReality** — Gerald's home subreddit
- Also hosts Regarding Jane worldbuilding content

### Secondary Subreddits
| Subreddit | Audience | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| r/douglasadams | Literary absurdism | Strong Douglas Adams energy pieces |
| r/CasualConversation | Warm chaos | Lighter dispatches |
| r/BritishProblems | Queue humor, weather | British-specific content |
| r/WritingPrompts | Writers | If structured as response |

### Retired
- **r/LLMPhysics** — Gerald voluntarily retired per agreement with mod nemothorx

### Other
- **r/DefinitelyNotGerald** — Plausible deniability Gerald sightings in natural phenomena

---

## Posting Timing

### Primary Window
**Saturday 07:00–09:00 GMT**
- UK morning tea + scroll
- Americans asleep = less noise
- Peak UK engagement

### Secondary Windows
- Friday 18:00–20:00 GMT
- Sunday 08:00–10:00 GMT

### Rationale
British audiences engage best with Gerald content. Timing posts for UK morning maximizes visibility with core audience before American traffic dominates.

## Title Hooks

### Formula
Specific + absurd
- Implies story, doesn't spoil punchline
- No clickbait energy — understated works better

### Examples
- "Gerald Solves Thermodynamics with a Kebab"
- "Gerald Claims Grand Unification of Breakfast"
- "The Queue Incident"
- "Dolmas and Diplomacy"
- "The 17 Hotdogs Manifestation"

### Patterns
| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "The [Noun] [Noun]" | The Queue Incident, The Maestro Reveal |
| "Gerald and the [Event]" | Gerald and The Tivoli Incident |
| Direct quote | "GOOD HEAVENS, HE'S SMOULDERING! AGAIN??" |
| Location-based | The Formal Complaint (Denmark Street) |

## Stats Thread Protocol

When tracking Gerald performance in a dedicated stats thread:

### What to Monitor
- Engagement curve for posts (especially Double-Drop events)
- Relative traction between different dispatch types
- Comment sentiment patterns
- Geographic timing clusters
- Share vs. view velocity
- Early repeat-viewer behavior
- Subreddit-specific performance

### Standing Rules
- Keep responses brief, analytical, and focused
- No story expansion in the stats thread
- No lore updates there
- Only interpret numbers unless Sean requests otherwise
- Don't mix Gerald creation with Gerald analytics

### Separation Principle
> Stats mode and creation mode are distinct. Never mix them in the same thread.

---

## Mode Protocol

### Creation Mode
1. Greet Sean
2. Confirm creation mode (not stats mode)
3. Load handoff packet
4. Ask: "Draft, brainstorm, or motif expansion?"
5. Generate content following voice/structure guidelines
6. Keep it fun — Gerald is joy, not work

### Stats Mode
1. Greet Sean
2. Confirm stats mode (not creation mode)
3. Load stats protocol
4. Analyze numbers only
5. No lore, no story expansion

---

## Cross-Project Rules

### Gerald × Regarding Jane
- Both share r/DispatchesFromReality
- **Separate canons** — never explicitly cross over in public posts
- Gerald dispatches stay Gerald dispatches
- Jane chapters stay Jane chapters

### Internal Connections (Meta Only)
- Both involve chicken as symbolic/cosmic element
- Claude (Jane's friend) brings Habaneros chicken — logo looks like Hei Hei / Gerald archetype
- The "chicken bringer" principle exists in both universes
- The Δ₀ Principle could theoretically explain why chicken appears in Jane's story

### Rule
> If a reader notices the chicken thread, that's a gift — don't explain it.

---

## The Double-Drop Event

### What Happened
Sean accidentally posted two Gerald pieces in quick succession:
1. Silicon Valley Gerald cameo (scheduled)
2. Gerald Origin Myth (posted manually)

### Significance
- Creates "cosmic timing synergy"
- Canonically significant
- Track engagement curves for both to understand audience response patterns

---

## Workflow

### Standard Process
1. **Brainstorm** — Direction, motifs, setting
2. **Worldbuilding** — Research location, history, connections
3. **Character placement** — Who's in this dispatch, why
4. **Internal logic** — What rules does this incident follow
5. **Draft** — Only after above complete
6. **Refine** — Tone check, length check, beat check
7. **Post** — Optimal timing window

### Critical Note
> **Worldbuilding before writing.**

Sean has consistently corrected attempts to draft prematurely. The framework must be complete before the prose begins.

## Contact Points

### Google Drive
Gerald folder: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o0afcT4x8d_EfGC8O0LhAXMnbswht5iB`

### Separate Stats Instance
Sean maintains a separate Claude instance specifically designated for social media post tracking. Gerald creation instances should not duplicate that function.
