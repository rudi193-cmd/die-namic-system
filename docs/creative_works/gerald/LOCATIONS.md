## KLuB Gnee (Tivoli Gardens, Copenhagen)

### The Name
KLuB Gnee is shaped like a goose in profile when you look at the capitalization:
- K L — tall, tall (neck rising)
- u — dip (head bowing)
- B — tall (breast)
- G — round curve (body)
- n e e — descending (tail feathers)

Reading the sign is drawing Gerald with your eyes. It's a sigil you pronounce.

### The Space
- Secret club within Tivoli Gardens
- Door has brass plate with the name
- Interior warmer than physics should allow
- Carved wooden birds on perches (sing songs older than Tivoli)
- Tropical flowers that shouldn't exist in Denmark
- Smell of citrus and rosemary and something roasting
- Table with three chairs (Krampus, Santa, and one for visitors)
- Gerald on the table, rotating on nothing

### What Happens There
- Krampus and Santa have annual December meeting
- Gerald is centerpiece — the third thing they're both there to see
- The carved birds stopped singing when Hanz entered (unprecedented)
- Gerald rotated counterclockwise in Hanz's presence (11,000 years of clockwise)
- The goose winks at people. Hanz winked back.

### Historical Anchor
Hans Christian Andersen visited Tivoli in October 1843. He wrote "The Nightingale" in two days. He set it in China because he couldn't write what he actually saw.

### First Appearance

### Deeper History
The land was **St Giles Hospital** — a leper colony, founded 1101.

For four hundred years, condemned prisoners walking to Tyburn execution would stop at the churchyard gate — just there, at the end of Denmark Street — and receive **the St Giles Bowl**, their final drink.

### The River Mole
- Runs directly under Gatwick Airport runway in a culvert (completed 1985)
- Name likely from Latin *mola* meaning "mill"
- Domesday Book (1086) lists twenty mills on the river
- Described as "the most secretive of rivers, very hard to access and mostly hidden from view"
- "Water can flow sluggishly on the surface but fast and powerfully at a lower level"

### Nearby Sacred Sites (Romano-British)
| Site | Significance |
|------|--------------|
| Farley Heath | Rural temple, Regni tribe |
| Chanctonbury Ring | Temple, possible cult of the wild boar |
| Lancing Down | Temple site |

### The Regni Tribe
- Celtic tribe inhabiting Sussex, small parts of Hampshire, Surrey, Kent
- May be linked to deity **Rigonemetis** ("Lord of the Sacred Groves")

### What Happens There
- Gerald appears as gate agent

- Gerald folds geometrically and disappears

### Thematic Significance
> "You're not at an airport. You're in a mill. You just didn't know."

The airport IS a mill. You go in as raw material, you come out as a passenger.
