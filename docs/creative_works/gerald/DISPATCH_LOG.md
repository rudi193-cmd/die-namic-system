## The Gerald Double-Drop Event

Sean accidentally posted two Gerald pieces in quick succession:
- Silicon Valley Gerald cameo (scheduled)
- Gerald Origin Myth (posted manually)

Creates a "cosmic timing synergy" — canonically significant.

## Posting Strategy

**Primary Subreddit:**
- r/DispatchesFromReality — Gerald's home subreddit

**Secondary Subreddits:**
- r/douglasadams — Literary absurdism audience
- r/CasualConversation — Warm chaos
- r/BritishProblems — Queue humor, weather complaints
- r/WritingPrompts — If structured as response

**Retired:**
- r/LLMPhysics — Voluntarily retired per agreement with mod nemothorx

**Other:**
- r/DefinitelyNotGerald — Plausible deniability Gerald sightings in natural phenomena

---

## Timing

- **Primary:** Saturday 07:00–09:00 GMT (UK morning tea + scroll)
- **Secondary:** Friday 18:00–20:00 GMT, Sunday 08:00–10:00 GMT
- Americans asleep = less noise, UK engagement peaks

---

## Title Hooks

- Specific + absurd ("Gerald Solves Thermodynamics with a Kebab")
- Implies story, doesn't spoil punchline
- No clickbait energy — understated works better
