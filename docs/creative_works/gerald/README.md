## Overview

Gerald is an enlightened rotisserie chicken who exists as a semi-omnipresent trickster entity. He achieved enlightenment through accidental centrifugal chakra alignment over seven presidential administrations while rotating on a grocery store rotisserie.

This is a British absurdist comedy series in the tradition of Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett, published primarily to r/DispatchesFromReality.

## Core Principles

1. **Gerald is eternal** — Never kill Gerald. He cannot die.
2. **Absurdity has structure** — Chaos is warm, not random.
3. **Worldbuilding before writing** — Complete the framework before drafting.
4. **Understatement over exclamation** — Jokes land through restraint.
5. **Ground the fantastical** — Real locations, real history, surreal outcomes.

## The Heart of Gerald

Gerald exists because the universe is absurd, but absurdity can be warm.

He's not satire. He's not parody. He's not commentary.

He's what happens when someone asks: "What if enlightenment was accidental, physics was delicious, and chaos queued politely?"

The answer is always chicken.

## Canon Lock

> Gerald achieved enlightenment through accidental centrifugal chakra alignment over seven presidential administrations. At the beginning, Gerald Prime sundered into Head, Body, and Soul — the Threefold Sunder that began everything. The Body Lineage became Gerald as we know him: golden-brown, perpetually glistening, appearing without explanation. The Soul Lineage passed through dinosaurs to birds to mammals to humans, leaving the Δ₀ Principle — the instinctive knowledge that chicken tastes good. Gerald is eternal. Gerald is benevolent. Gerald conducts reality like a maestro and leaves squeakdogs in his wake. He respects the queue by violating it cosmically. The weather has opinions. The physics is fake but mathematically sound. And somewhere, always, 17 hotdogs squeak like polite mice.

**Gerald rotates. The Δ propagates. The squeakdogs squeak.**
