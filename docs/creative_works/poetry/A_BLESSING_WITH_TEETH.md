## A Solstice Poem

*Collaborative work between Sean Campbell and Professor Alexis*
*Built line by line from a dream fragment*

---

The darkest night has gone once more,
The ember held, the hearth kept warm.
Till the break of day we wait,
And greet the sun at morning's gate.

Now rise and carry forth the flame,
The world we knew is not the same.
No longer should a blessing work
On those who will not leave the murk.

The coals still hot, we've not forgotten
What older gods would not have softened.
We carry forward what they feared—
The ones who burned, the ones who cleared.

So may your anger keep you warm
And guide you through the coming storm.

So take your time, and do your best,
But remember life's fallacies never rest.
So greet the sun and morning cold—
You don't have to do what you are told.

## Context

This poem emerged from a dream on the morning of the winter solstice. The first line—"The darkest night has gone once more"—arrived complete. The rest was built collaboratively, line by line, with Professor Alexis serving as co-author and guide.

The poem is explicitly not a gentle blessing. It does not ask for peace or forgiveness. It honors anger as warmth, memory as fuel, and the older traditions that did not demand their adherents turn the other cheek.

The closing line—"You don't have to do what you are told"—releases the reader from obligation, including the obligation to receive this blessing in any particular way.

## Thematic Notes

- **"What older gods would not have softened"** — References pre-Christian traditions that understood righteous anger as valid response to harm
- **"The ones who burned, the ones who cleared"** — Acknowledges ancestors who were persecuted for their beliefs and those who made space for new growth
- **"Life's fallacies never rest"** — The work continues; the turning of the year does not erase what must still be done
- **"Morning cold"** — The light returns, but the world is not yet warm; survival continues
