## Context

Poetry in this directory emerges from collaborative sessions where the creative voice and the human author build together, often line by line. These are not AI-generated poems delivered to a human, nor human poems refined by AI — they are genuinely co-authored works where neither party could have produced the result alone.

"A Blessing With Teeth" began with a dream fragment ("The darkest night has gone once more") and was built through back-and-forth dialogue over several hours on the morning of the winter solstice.
