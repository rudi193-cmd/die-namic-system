**"THE GATE"**
*Key Decisions Made*

---

## Overview

This document tracks the 20 key decisions that define "The Gate" show concept. Each decision emerged from collaborative development and represents locked design elements.

---

## Show Architecture

### 1. Dual-Version Architecture
**Decision:** Corps performs traditional show all season, reveals dramatically transformed version only at Finals.
**Rationale:** Creates unprecedented competitive advantage. Judges see something new at Finals when scores matter most.
**Date:** Initial concept

### 2. The Three Changes (Season → Finals)
**Decision:** Only three elements change between season and Finals: (1) Dog present/absent, (2) Brass moving/still, (3) Standard/swapped parts.
**Rationale:** Minimizes rehearsal burden while maximizing impact. Everything else stays identical.
**Date:** Initial concept

## Transformation Ritual

### 3. 51-Count Transformation Ritual
**Decision:** Transformation structured as kata: 17 counts instruments down, 17 counts jacket removal, 17 counts placement/retrieval.
**Rationale:** Trinitarian structure (17+17+17). Teaches as ritual form, not counts. Prime number segments can't be subdivided.
**Date:** Development phase

### 4. 72-Count Total Ritual
**Decision:** 51-count kata + 20 counts stillness + 1 count turn = 72 total.
**Rationale:** 72 ÷ π always approaches primes. Mathematical significance creates felt resonance.
**Date:** Development phase

### 5. 42 Measures Brass Stillness
**Decision:** During Great Gate (Finals only), brass stands motionless for exactly 42 measures.
**Rationale:** Creates chaos for marching judge (nothing to judge). Stillness becomes louder than movement.
**Date:** Development phase

---

## Drill Vocabulary

### 6. Four Sacred Angles
**Decision:** Great Gate drill uses ONLY four angles: 90°, 45°, 33°, 72°.
**Rationale:** 90°/45° = stability. 72° = sacred geometry. 33° = tension (vertebrae count, not a factor of 360).
**Date:** Development phase

### 7. B-M-T-Tu Interleaved Grid
**Decision:** 8×8 brass formation uses Baritone-Mellophone-Trumpet-Tuba repeating pattern.
**Rationale:** Defeats individual caption judging (can't isolate sections), maximizes ensemble/effect scores.
**Date:** Development phase

### 8. Mellophone/Trumpet Part Swap
**Decision:** At Finals, mellophones play trumpet parts, trumpets play mellophone parts.
**Rationale:** Creates warmth instead of brightness. Learned organically (singing on bus, noodling in tunnels).
**Date:** Development phase

### 9. Baba Yaga as "String Thrown at Paper"
**Decision:** Baba Yaga drill is chaotic, curved, Blue Knights-style — but four corners always anchored.
**Rationale:** Contrast with sacred geometry of Great Gate. The frame holds even when interior is chaos.
**Date:** Development phase

## Visual Elements

### 10. ~96 Garments on Field
**Decision:** 64 brass jackets + ~32 guard tops dropped on field during transformation.
**Rationale:** Worker solidarity memorial. Corps sheds what they were to become what they're crossing into.
**Date:** Development phase

### 11. Guard Transformation: Villager → Slavic Folk
**Decision:** Guard transforms from plain villagers (earth tones) to vibrant Slavic folk dress (reds, whites, blues).
**Rationale:** Cultural metamorphosis theme. Industrial Revolution adoption in Slavic regions.
**Date:** Development phase

### 12. Male Guard: Hungarian Formal
**Decision:** Male guard reveals Hungarian formal dress (braided/embroidered trousers + vest).
**Rationale:** Maintains Slavic regional authenticity. Visual distinction from female transformation.
**Date:** Development phase

### 13. Staggered Organic Awakening
**Decision:** Guard transformation during Quiet Crisis is staggered, not synchronized — ripples across field.
**Rationale:** Creates organic "awakening" feel. Map determines who transforms first (spark) and last (seal).
**Date:** Development phase

### 14. Structured Shoulders ("Johnny Newman Style")
**Decision:** Brass jackets have structured, Slavic ceremonial shoulders that create spine/vertebrae pattern when laid flat.
**Rationale:** 64 jackets × 2 "horns" = 128 points radiating outward. Corps leaves its skeleton on field.
**Date:** Development phase

---

## Exit Sequence

### 15. Dog Gag for Season, Absence for Finals
**Decision:** Season shows include playful dog gag at exit. Finals: no dog — Handler retrieves toy, hesitates, takes it offstage.
**Rationale:** The absence of joy is what devastates. Dog was never performance — staff member's dog who became family.
**Date:** Development phase

### 16. DM Exit in 7/4 Time
**Decision:** DM marches off alone in 7/4 time after hat placement at 10-yard line.
**Rationale:** Out of sync with everything else. The crossing they make alone.
**Date:** Development phase

---

## Business / Outreach

### 17. Blue Knights Seed Letter
**Decision:** Initial outreach to Blue Knights via seed letter (teaser), not full package.
**Rationale:** Gauge interest before committing full documentation.
**Date:** November 2025

### 18. Academy Full Package
**Decision:** Share complete 7-document package with The Academy via Google Drive.
**Rationale:** Leadership transition timing optimal. Position as breakthrough opportunity.
**Date:** November 2025

### 19. Santa Clara Vanguard as Backup
**Decision:** Hold SCV in reserve if BK and Academy pass.
**Rationale:** Top-tier corps = different pitch angle. Save for last.
**Date:** November 2025

### 20. Transparency Clause
**Decision:** "All terms negotiable if agreed upon in writing." Transparent about pitching to multiple organizations.
**Rationale:** Maintains integrity. Creates healthy competition. Finds best home for show.
**Date:** Initial approach
