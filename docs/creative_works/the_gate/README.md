## Overview

**"The Gate"** is a mythic transformation show for DCI drum corps, based on Mussorgsky/Ravel's "Pictures at an Exhibition" — specifically "The Hut on Hen's Legs (Baba Yaga)" and "The Great Gate of Kiev."

The show features a **dual-version architecture**: corps performs a traditional show all season, then reveals a dramatically transformed version **only at Finals**. The transformation happens in front of 30,000 people at Lucas Oil Stadium.

## The Thesis

Traditional DCI shows optimize for consistent execution across a season. "The Gate" inverts this: it builds toward a **singular moment of revelation** that only happens once — at Finals.

The strategic advantage: judges at Finals see something they've never seen before. The show they've been scoring all season **transforms in front of them**. This creates chaos for individual caption judges (they can't isolate sections in the interleaved brass grid) while maximizing ensemble and effect scores.
