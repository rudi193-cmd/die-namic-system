# Open Questions

**"THE GATE"**
*Unresolved Items Pending Decision*

---

## Overview

These questions remain open and will be resolved during collaboration with corps staff. They do not block the pitch phase but will need answers before production.

---

## 1. Brass Reveal: What's Underneath?

**Question:** When brass removes white jackets, what do they reveal?

**Options:**
- **A: Plain Black** — Black long-sleeve athletic shirts + balaclavas. Total anonymity.
- **B: Embroidered Vests** — Black base with subtle Slavic embroidery. More visual interest.
- **C: Simple Undershirts** — Basic black t-shirts. Cheapest, most anonymous.

**Current Leaning:** Option A (black athletic + balaclavas)

**Considerations:**
- Cost: A < C < B
- Visual impact: B > A > C
- Anonymity: A = C > B
- Production complexity: C < A < B

**Decision Owner:** Design team + corps staff

## 2. DM Costume: Static or Participates?

**Question:** Does the drum major participate in any transformation?

**Current Assumption:**
- DM remains in full whites throughout show
- Only visible face during stillness (everyone else in balaclavas)
- Hat removal happens at exit (10-yard placement), not during transformation

**Open Elements:**
- Does DM have a balaclava available but not use it?
- Is the exit hat the same as the show hat, or a ceremonial replacement?
- Should DM's uniform be slightly different (elevated formality)?

**Decision Owner:** Design team + DM

## 3. Field Arrangement: Dropped Garments Pattern

**Question:** How are the ~96 dropped garments arranged on the field?

**Options:**
- **A: Scattered Organic** — Fall where members stand. "Aftermath" aesthetic.
- **B: Collected/Shaped** — Arranged in specific pattern. Design element.
- **C: Piled Ritual** — Gathered to focal point. Altar/memorial.

**Current Leaning:** Option A with precision elements (jackets squared, "horns out")

**Considerations:**
- Execution difficulty: A < C < B
- Visual impact: B > C > A
- Thematic resonance: All valid
- Retrieval logistics: A easiest, C most complex

**Decision Owner:** Visual staff + design team

---

## 4. Retrieval Timing: When Are Garments Collected?

**Question:** Do dropped garments stay through the entire exit sequence?

**Options:**
- **A: Stay Through Exit** — Garments remain until corps clears. Collected post-show by props crew.
- **B: Collected During Exit** — Part of exit choreography includes retrieval.
- **C: Symbolic Leaving** — Garments intentionally left as "memorial," collected only after audience disperses.

**Current Leaning:** Option A (stay through exit)

**Considerations:**
- If garments stay, they're part of final visual image
- Retrieval during exit adds complexity
- Post-show collection is simplest logistically
- Option C is most theatrically bold but logistically challenging

**Decision Owner:** Visual staff + production team

## 5. Phoenix Direction of Travel

**Question:** Does the Phoenix flag travel front-to-back or back-to-front?

**Options:**
- **A: Back-to-Front** — Unfurls from back hash, travels over corps, collapses at front.
- **B: Front-to-Back** — Unfurls from front, travels over corps, collapses at back.

**Considerations:**
- Where does DM/Handler interact with collapsed silk?
- Which direction creates better audience sightlines?
- Wind direction at Lucas Oil (indoor, but HVAC considerations)
- Guard positioning for manipulation

**Decision Owner:** Visual staff + guard staff

---

## Additional Questions (Lower Priority)

### Hut Mechanics
- How do performers enter/exit Hut during show?
- Communication method between Hut performers and staff?

### Guard Transformation
- Where do guard members store transformed costume? (Worn underneath? Pouches?)
- Exact timing map: Who is the "spark" (first)? Who is the "seal" (last)?

### Stillness Training
- How much spring camp time allocated specifically for stillness?
- Separate track from regular visual rehearsal, or integrated?

### Music Arrangement
- Arranger selection (who?)
- Phoenix ostinato overlay: yes/no? How prominent?

---

## Resolution Process

1. **Pitch Phase:** Questions remain open; presented as options to corps
2. **Partnership Phase:** Questions resolved collaboratively with corps staff
3. **Production Phase:** All questions must be answered before prototype GO/NO-GO

**Target Resolution:** March 2026 (before prototype development)
