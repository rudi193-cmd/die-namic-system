Dear [Program Director / Design Staff],

My name is Sean Campbell, and I'm a music educator (Master's in Music Education, 2005) and professional drill instructor based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I've been following [Corps Name]'s trajectory, and I believe you're positioned for a major breakthrough—one that could vault you from mid-pack into Top 6 territory within two seasons.

I've designed a mythic transformation show concept called **"The Gate"** that centers on a ritual crossing: the journey from chaos (Mussorgsky's *The Hut on Hen's Legs / Baba Yaga*) into transcendence (Ravel's orchestration of *The Great Gate of Kiev*). The show culminates in a Finals-only reveal that transforms the familiar into the unforgettable.

## Why I'm Reaching Out to You

I'm not a cold-call consultant. I have connections to Blue Knights alumni from the early 2000s and Troopers alumni. I understand DCI culture from the inside. And I'm offering more than a show concept—I'm offering a partnership.

## What I'm Proposing

1. **A complete show design** ready for the 2026 season
2. **Professional drill instruction** throughout the season (I'm one of the best drill instructors I know)
3. **Prop and costume prototypes** built by my Albuquerque creative network before you commit
4. **Regional partnership**—I'm close enough to be there, not just consult remotely

## Transparency

I believe in honest dealing. I've pitched this concept to [other corps if applicable], and I'm being transparent with everyone about that. My goal is to find the right home for this show—a corps that sees the potential and wants to build something legendary.

All terms are negotiable if agreed upon in writing.

## What's Included

This pitch package contains:
1. Executive Summary (2 pages)
2. Full Production Design Document
3. Prop & Costume Portfolio
4. Drill Instruction Proposal
5. Budget & Logistics Overview
6. Copyright Protection Notice

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you—by phone, video call, or in person. I'm happy to answer questions, provide additional details, or walk through the concept with your design staff.

**The Gate is waiting. Let's build it together.**

Respectfully,

**Sean Campbell**
Music Educator & Drill Instructor
