## 2. Corps Configuration

**DCI Standard (max 165)**

| Section | Count | Formation Role |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| Brass | 64 | 8×8 square perimeter (16 each: Tpt, Mello, Bari, Tuba) |
| Battery | ~30 | Center of square, counterclockwise rotation |
| Pit | ~12 | Front sideline, standard |
| Guard | ~32 | Inside/around square, clockwise rotation |
| DM | 1 | Podium (front) → Center podium (Finals) |

### Brass Voicing

**Season Shows:**
- Standard: Trumpets play trumpet parts, mellophones play mellophone parts

**Finals Only:**
- Swap: Mellophones play trumpet parts (heroic lines), trumpets play mellophone parts (support)
- Creates warmth instead of brightness
- Learned organically all season through passive absorption

---

## 3. Show Timeline

### Pre-Show

**Season:**
- Corps enters, assembles into square, announcer begins

**Finals:**
- Corps enters in whites (looks identical to season)
- 10-15 second delay
- Whisper: "Tonight... the Gate is waiting..."
- Announcer begins

### Show Start

**Both Season & Finals:**
- Battery begins Baba Yaga heartbeat cadence BEFORE announcer finishes
- Unconventional, creates unease
- Brass maintain perfect stillness

---

## 4. Movement I: Baba Yaga

### Character
"A string thrown at drill paper" — chaotic, free-flowing, organic

### Drill Elements
- Curved paths, arcs, swirls
- Vortex/rotating rings:
  - Guard: clockwise ring
  - Battery: counterclockwise ring
  - Brass: flows around, but FOUR CORNERS ALWAYS ANCHORED
- Blue Knights-style fluidity
- High demand, high energy

### The Hut
- Lightweight construction (silk + PVC)
- Two performers animate it (Baba Yaga + Assistant)
- Season: low to ground, twitching
- Finals: stands on stilt-legs (Da Vinci walking mechanism)

### Key Moments
1. Hut twitches after first brass blast
2. Assistant tries to "warn the world" (E♭ on glockenspiel, out of sync)
3. DM descends from podium, guides Assistant back
4. Hut receives her
5. Vortex reaches peak chaos

### Quiet Crisis (Percussion Reflection)
Non-traditional "drum break" — not full battery, not a stop in music

Instruments:
- Glockenspiel (E♭)
- Woodblocks
- Anvils
- Shakers
- Frame drums

**Guard Transformation (Finals):**
- Quick-change to Slavic layers happens here
- Staggered, organic (not synchronized)
- Ripples across field like an awakening

---

## 5. Movement II: The Great Gate of Kiev

### Season Version

- Traditional brass arcs and movement
- Guard flourishes
- Normal crescendos
- Full corps returns to conventional staging
- Dog gag at end (playful, crowd-pleasing)

### Finals Version

#### Sacred Geometry Drill
All formations use ONLY four angles: 90°, 45°, 33°, 72°

#### The Stillness
- Brass stands MOTIONLESS for 42 measures
- Facing center
- Guard/battery continue normal choreography inside
- This is the ONLY change to drill

#### Interleaved Brass Grid
- B-M-T-Tu pattern repeating across 8×8 perimeter
- Creates harmonic field (every yard line has all four voices)
- Individual caption judges cannot isolate sections

#### Mellophone Opening Feature
- Trumpet/mello parts swapped
- Mello warmth signals transformation

#### The Turn (Measure 43)
- Brass slowly, synchronously rotates to face AUDIENCE
- Takes approximately 8 measures
- The Gate that was facing inward now faces outward

#### Gate Unfurling
- Hut unrolls into full Great Gate backdrop
- Large silk, full-span, dramatic

---

## 6. The Transformation Ritual

### Timing
Happens during 15-20 second silence between Baba Yaga and Great Gate (Finals only)

### The 51-Count Kata

| Counts | Action |
|--------|--------|
| 1-17 | Instruments down (surrender) |
| 18-34 | Jacket removal (shedding) |
| 35-51 | Jacket/hat placement + instrument retrieval + turn to center |

**Count 52:** Set at attention
**Counts 53-72:** Five measures of stillness (20 counts)

### Visual Result
- 64 white jackets flat on turf (squared, "horns" out — looks like spine)
- 64 hats between feet
- 64 faceless figures in all-black (balaclavas)
- DM alone in whites on center podium
- ~96 total garments on field (brass + guard)

---

## 7. The Exit Sequence

### Season Shows
1. Phoenix unfurls and collapses
2. DM retrieves toy from collapse
3. Dog wanders over, playful chaos
4. DM and dog exit together
5. Crowd loves it

### Finals Show
1. Phoenix unfurls and collapses (same blocking)
2. **Handler** retrieves toy (not DM)
3. Handler places toy near where DM will stand
4. Handler hesitates (2-3 seconds)
5. Handler picks up toy, carries it offstage toward props
6. Corps condenses into two lines
7. DM joins at front corner (65 total)
8. March toward back hash
9. **DM stops at 10-yard line**
10. Full drum major salute (the perfected version)
11. DM removes hat, places on ground
12. Crisp about-face
13. **DM marches off alone in 7/4 time**
14. Hat remains on field
15. Offstage eruption from tunnel

---

## 8. Rehearsal Strategy

### Mellophone/Trumpet Swap

**The Strategy: Passive Organic Learning**

Throughout season:
- Staff subtly encourages cross-section familiarity
- "Trumpets, can you sing the mello line? Just for blend."
- "Mellos, hum the trumpet fanfare—let's hear how it fits."

By July:
- Both sections have PASSIVELY learned both parts
- No formal "learn the swap" rehearsal needed

Finals week:
- "For Finals, trumpets play mello parts, mellos play trumpet parts."
- Members: "Wait, we already KNOW these."
- Staff: "Exactly."

### Stillness Training

Requires specific instruction (Monte's domain):
- Posture that can be held without drift
- Breath control
- Eye focus
- Weight distribution

Standing still for 42 measures is harder than moving. It requires discipline.

### The Kata

Taught as ritual form, not counts:
- Breath
- Presence
- Intention arriving when it should
- Three segments: Surrender, Shedding, Crossing

---

## Summary: The Three Changes

| Element | Season | Finals |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Dog** | Present, playful exit | Absent — Handler takes toy |
| **Brass Drill** | Flowing, moving | Motionless 42 measures |
| **Parts** | Standard voicing | Mello/trumpet swap |

**Everything else identical.** Guard choreography, battery staging, Baba Yaga drill, Phoenix flag, music.
