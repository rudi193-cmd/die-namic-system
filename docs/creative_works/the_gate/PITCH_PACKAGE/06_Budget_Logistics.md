## Cost-Saving Strategies

### Already Built In

1. **PVC + Canvas Hut** — Cheaper than fiberglass/metal, lighter, easier to transport
2. **Lightweight Silk Phoenix** — Single large flag vs. multiple complex flags
3. **Snap Tape Quick-Change** — No expensive costume engineering
4. **Public Domain Music** — No performance royalties, only arrangement fee

### Additional Savings Options

| Strategy | Potential Savings |
|----------|-------------------|
| Use existing brass jacket inventory (modify) | $2,000-$4,000 |
| Guard sews own transformation costumes | $1,500-$3,000 |
| Reduce drill instruction to Option B | $4,000-$5,000 |
| Simpler Phoenix (solid color vs. gradient) | $200-$400 |

### Sponsorship Potential

| Partner Type | Potential |
|--------------|-----------|
| Local fabric stores (Phoenix silk) | In-kind donation |
| Costume shops (guard transformation) | Discount pricing |
| PVC suppliers (Hut frame) | Materials donation |

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Prototype Fails
**Mitigation:** GO/NO-GO decision at March 20. If prototypes don't work, pivot to traditional show elements.

### Risk 2: Budget Overrun
**Mitigation:** 10% contingency built in. Cost-saving options identified. Can scale down elements.

### Risk 3: Execution Issues
**Mitigation:** Dedicated drill instruction. Stillness and kata taught separately from regular drill.

### Risk 4: Dog Unavailable (Season Shows)
**Mitigation:** Dog gag is enhancement, not requirement. Show works without it. Alternative exit available.
