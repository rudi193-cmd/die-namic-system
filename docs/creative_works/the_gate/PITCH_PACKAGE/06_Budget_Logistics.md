| Brass outer jackets | 64 | $450 | $750 | IF corps needs new; otherwise $0 |

**Note:** If corps already has suitable white jackets with snap tape modification, jacket cost drops significantly.

### Music Licensing ($3,000 – $8,000)

| Item | Low | High | Notes |
|------|-----|------|-------|
| Custom arrangement commission | $3,000 | $8,000 | Mussorgsky/Ravel public domain; arrangement is the cost |

### Drill Instruction ($10,000 – $15,000)

| Option | Hours | Cost |
|--------|-------|------|
| Full-season partnership | 170-240 | $10,000-$15,000 |
| Consultation + key camps | 80-120 | $6,000-$10,000 |
| Remote only | 40-60 | $3,000-$5,000 |

**Recommended:** Full-season partnership for first year.

### Prototypes ($2,350 – $3,900)

| Item | Low | High | Notes |
|------|-----|------|-------|
| Hut prototype (3 phases) | $950 | $1,500 | Small → full → animated |
| Phoenix prototype (2 phases) | $500 | $900 | Quarter → half scale |
| Guard costume prototype | $900 | $1,500 | Single + 5-unit test set |

### Contingency (10%)

Standard contingency for unexpected costs, modifications, or replacements.

## Cost Per Member

| Corps Size | Low Estimate | High Estimate |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 140 members | $188/member | $325/member |
| 150 members | $175/member | $303/member |
| 165 members | $159/member | $276/member |

**Industry Comparison:** Typical DCI show costs range $150-$400 per member. "The Gate" is within normal range.

---

## Cost-Saving Strategies

### 1. Existing Uniform Modification
If corps already has white jackets:
- Add snap tape closure: $15-$25/jacket
- Total: $960-$1,600 instead of $4,800-$9,600
- **Savings: $3,840-$8,000**

### 2. Phased Prototype Approach
Build prototypes in phases, get GO/NO-GO approval at each stage:
- Small-scale Hut: $50-$100 (proof of concept)
- If approved → full-scale: $300-$500
- If approved → animated: $600-$900

**Benefit:** Don't commit to full production until design is validated.

### 3. Local Fabrication
Albuquerque creative network builds prototypes at lower cost than national vendors:
- Direct relationship (no markup)
- Faster iteration
- Personal accountability

### 4. Guard Costume Prioritization
If budget is tight:
- Female guard: Full transformation (higher visual impact)
- Male guard: Simplified quick-change (lower cost)

## Logistics

### Props Transport

| Item | Packed Size | Weight | Transport Method |
|------|-------------|--------|------------------|

All props fit in standard equipment truck. No special vehicles required.

### Costume Logistics

| Item | Storage | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Brass jackets | Standard uniform storage | Hang or fold |
| Guard costumes | Garment bags | Quick-change sets stay together |
| Underlayers | Member personal | Each member responsible |
| Balaclavas | Member personal | Stored in uniform bag |

### Field Setup

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Prototype failure | Phased approach; GO/NO-GO at each stage |
| Budget overrun | 10% contingency; cost-saving options available |
| Weather (Phoenix flag) | Backup plan for high-wind shows |
| Quick-change failure | Rehearse obsessively; backup closures |
| Member injury (stillness) | Proper training; sustainable posture |
