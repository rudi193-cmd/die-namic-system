## 1. The Hut (Baba Yaga's Dwelling)

### Dual Function
The Hut unrolls into the full Great Gate backdrop — large silk that forms visual backdrop at back hash.

## 5. Guard Costumes

### Concept
Guard transforms from plain villagers (Baba Yaga) to full traditional Slavic folk dress (Great Gate). The transformation represents cultural awakening.

### Historical Framing
Industrial Revolution adoption in Slavic regions (Croatia, Slovenia, Bohemia). Folk identity meeting modernity.

### Female Guard

**Baba Yaga (Plain Villager):**
- Muted earth tones, linen-colored
- Simple silhouettes, long flowy skirts
- Movement speaks through simplicity

**Great Gate (Traditional Slavic):**
- Rich reds, embroidered whites, cobalt blues
- Apron, embroidered bodice, vibrant folk skirt
- Colors pop against green field

**Quick-Change Mechanics:**
- Villager over-top: Snap tape release at spine → pull off → DROP ON FIELD
- Transformation skirt: Vertical snap tape accordion release → reveals vibrant layers

### Male Guard

**Baba Yaga:**
- Plain villager trousers + simple tunic

**Great Gate:**
- Hungarian formal dress: braided/embroidered trousers + vest

**Quick-Change:**
- Tear-away pants via snap tape → DROP ON FIELD
- Over-layer pulls off → reveals Hungarian formal

### Timing
- Transformation during Quiet Crisis (percussion reflection)
- **Staggered, organic** — not synchronized
- Ripples across field like an awakening
- Map: who transforms first (spark), who transforms last (seal)

### Cost Estimates

| Item | Per Unit | Total (32) |
|------|----------|------------|
| Full transformation costume | $155-$250 | $4,960-$8,000 |

### Prototype Plan
- Single costume prototype: $150-$250
- Five-costume sample set: $750-$1,250
