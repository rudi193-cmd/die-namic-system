# Executive Summary

**"THE GATE"**
*A Mythic Transformation Show for the 2026 DCI Season*

---

## The Concept

"The Gate" is a ritual-myth field production about transformation, fearlessness, legacy, and the crossing from childhood into mythic adulthood.

**Music:**
- Mussorgsky/Ravel — *The Hut on Hen's Legs (Baba Yaga)*
- Mussorgsky/Ravel — *The Great Gate of Kiev*

**Target:** 2026 DCI World Championship Finals — August 8, 2026, Lucas Oil Stadium

---

## The Innovation: Dual-Version Architecture

"The Gate" uses an unprecedented structure: the corps performs a **traditional show all season**, then reveals a **dramatically transformed version only at Finals**.

### Season Shows (Weeks 1-12)
- Traditional DCI aesthetic
- Flowing, dynamic drill
- Crowd-pleasing moments
- Consistent, scoreable execution

### Finals Show (Championship Night Only)
- 51-count transformation ritual
- 42 measures of brass stillness
- Interleaved brass grid (B-M-T-Tu pattern)
- ~96 uniforms left on field as visual memorial
- DM's legendary exit: salute, hat on field, 7/4 march off alone

**The result:** Judges at Finals see something they've never seen before. The show they've been scoring all season transforms in front of them.

## The Strategic Advantage

### What the Design Does to Judging

The interleaved brass grid creates chaos for individual caption judges (they can't isolate sections) while maximizing ensemble and effect scores.

**You lose:** ~1.5-2.5 points in individual brass captions
**You gain:** ~3.5-6.5 points in ensemble, effect, and GE

**Net result:** +2 to 4 points — you WIN the trade under the current scoring model.

## The Numbers

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Transformation ritual | 51 counts (17 + 17 + 17) |
| Stillness duration | 42 measures |
| Total ritual counts | 72 (always π away from primes) |
| Uniforms on field | ~96 (64 brass + 32 guard) |
| Sacred drill angles | 4 (90°, 45°, 33°, 72°) |

## Projected Outcomes

### For a Mid-Tier Corps (Current ~91.5, 16th place)

**Year 1:**
- Projected Score: 95.0-96.5
- Projected Placement: 4th-6th (Top 6)
- Improvement: 10-12 places

**Year 2 (Refined):**
- Projected Score: 96.5-97.5
- Projected Placement: 2nd-4th (Medal contention)

## Why This Show, Why Now

The dual-version architecture has never been done at this level. The first corps to execute it creates a new category of show design—and gets the full credit for the innovation.

DCI scoring has shifted toward effect and ensemble. "The Gate" is designed for that shift. The stillness, the transformation, the interleaved grid—all maximize the captions that matter most under the current system.
