## Costume Transformation Mechanics

### Brass Jacket Removal

**Problem:** 64 members must remove jackets in 17 counts (approximately 10-12 seconds)

**Solution: Snap Tape Front Closure**
- Single pull-down motion releases entire front
- No buttons, no zippers
- Practiced until automatic

**Snap Tape Specifications:**
- Heavy-duty snap tape (size 20 or larger)
- Spaced every 2-3 inches
- Reinforced at stress points (chest, waist)
- Tested for 50+ cycles before season

**Backup Closure:**
- Velcro strip behind snap tape
- If snap tape fails, velcro holds
- Silent release (no ripping sound)

### Jacket Placement Visual

**Problem:** Dropped jackets must create intentional visual pattern, not look like laundry

**Solution: Structured Shoulders**
- "Johnny Newman style" — Slavic ceremonial silhouette
- Structured shoulder pads that hold shape when laid flat
- When jacket on ground: shoulders create "horns" pointing outward
- 64 jackets × 2 shoulders = 128 radiating points
- From above: looks like vertebral column/spine

**Placement Training:**
- Counts 35-38 of kata: jacket placement
- Members trained to square jacket at feet
- Shoulders oriented outward
- Practice until placement is instinctive

### Guard Quick-Change

**Female Guard Transformation:**

**Layer 1 (Baba Yaga - outer):**
- Plain villager over-top
- Snap tape release at spine (single pull)
- DROP ON FIELD (becomes part of memorial)

**Layer 2 (Great Gate - revealed):**
- Transformation skirt with vertical snap tape accordion
- Release reveals vibrant Slavic folk dress
- Reds, whites, cobalt blues

**Male Guard Transformation:**

**Layer 1 (Baba Yaga - outer):**
- Plain villager trousers + simple tunic
- Tear-away via snap tape at sides

**Layer 2 (Great Gate - revealed):**
- Hungarian formal dress
- Braided/embroidered trousers + vest

## Uniform Drop Concept

### The Memorial

~96 garments remain on field after transformation:
- 64 brass jackets
- ~32 guard outer layers

**Thematic Meaning:**
- Worker solidarity memorial
- The ones who came before
- What we shed to become what we're crossing into

### Field Arrangement Options

**Option A: Scattered Organic**
- Garments lie where dropped
- Natural, unplanned look
- Risk: could look messy

**Option B: Collected/Shaped**
- Placement creates intentional pattern
- Requires precise training
- Cleaner visual

**Option C: Ritual Piles**
- Guard collects brass jackets during Great Gate
- Creates deliberate memorial piles
- Most theatrical, most complex

**Current Preference:** Option B — trained placement during kata creates pattern without additional choreography.

## Open Questions

### 1. Brass Reveal: What's Underneath?

**Options:**
- White shirts (simple, clean contrast)
- Embroidered vests (Slavic detail)
- Simple black undershirts (total blackout with balaclavas)

**Current Direction:** All-black (long-sleeve athletic + balaclavas) for maximum contrast

**Unresolved:** Does any accent color appear? Gold trim? Embroidered detail?

### 2. DM Costume: Static or Participates?

**Options:**
- DM remains in full whites throughout (never transforms)
- DM removes jacket with corps but keeps hat
- DM does modified transformation

**Current Direction:** DM stays in full whites — the only face visible, the anchor point

**Unresolved:** Does DM remove any element before final exit?

### 3. Retrieval Timing

**Options:**
- Dropped garments stay through exit (retrieved post-show)
- Guard collects during Great Gate (part of choreography)
- Props crew retrieves during applause

**Current Direction:** Stay through exit — retrieved post-show only

**Unresolved:** Any insurance/liability concerns with garments on field during march-off?

### 4. Weather Contingency

**Problem:** Snap tape less reliable in rain/humidity

**Options:**
- Backup velcro layer
- Weather-specific closure testing
- Rain show modification (simplified transformation?)

**Unresolved:** Full rain contingency plan needed

## Prototype Testing Checklist

### Snap Tape Reliability
- [ ] Test 50+ open/close cycles
- [ ] Test in humidity (spray bottle simulation)
- [ ] Test at performance speed
- [ ] Test with sweaty hands
- [ ] Test with gloves (if applicable)

### Jacket Placement
- [ ] Structured shoulders hold shape on turf
- [ ] Shoulder "horns" visible from press box
- [ ] Placement timing achievable in 4 counts
- [ ] Pattern recognizable from above

### Guard Quick-Change
- [ ] Female transformation achievable in 8-10 counts
- [ ] Male transformation achievable in 8-10 counts
- [ ] Staggered timing looks organic (not synchronized)
- [ ] Dropped layers don't tangle feet

### Balaclava
- [ ] Breathable during performance
- [ ] Doesn't fog glasses (if applicable)
- [ ] Pulls from pocket cleanly
- [ ] On in 2-3 counts

## Cost Optimization Notes

### If Budget Tight:

**Priority 1:** Snap tape modification on existing jackets ($15-$25/jacket)
**Priority 2:** Guard quick-change costumes (highest visual impact)
**Priority 3:** Underlayers + balaclavas (relatively cheap)
**Priority 4:** New brass jackets (only if existing unsuitable)

### Vendor Options:

**Local (Albuquerque):**
- Johnny's network for quick-change expertise
- Local seamstress for modifications
- Faster iteration, lower cost

**National:**
- Band Shoppe, Stanbury, etc.
- Higher cost, longer lead time
- May be necessary for full production run
