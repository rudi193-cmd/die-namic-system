## Costume Quick-Change Mechanics

### Brass Jacket Removal

**Current Design:**
- Snap tape front closure (full length)
- Structured shoulders (Slavic ceremonial style)
- Lightweight fabric (waxed cotton or similar)

**Release Sequence:**
1. Hands to front closure (counts 18-20)
2. Single downward motion releases snap tape (counts 21-23)
3. Shoulders roll back, jacket slides (counts 24-26)
4. Jacket clears body (counts 27-30)
5. Jacket held for placement (counts 31-34)

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] Snap tape gauge (lighter = easier release, heavier = more secure)
- [ ] Collar attachment (does collar release with front, or separate?)
- [ ] Cuff situation (fitted cuffs vs. loose?)

### Jacket Placement

**Current Design:**
- Jacket laid flat at feet
- Squared, structured shoulders ("horns") pointing outward
- Creates spine/vertebrae pattern when all 64 are down

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] Placement precision: How exact does positioning need to be?
- [ ] Wind considerations: Do jackets need weighted hems?
- [ ] Retrieval: Do jackets stay through exit, or collected post-show?

### Guard Transformation

**Female Guard:**
- Villager over-top: Snap tape release at spine
- Pull off, DROP ON FIELD
- Transformation skirt: Vertical snap tape accordion release

**Male Guard:**
- Villager trousers + tunic: Tear-away via snap tape
- DROP ON FIELD
- Reveals Hungarian formal dress

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] Where do guard members hide transformed costume? (Worn underneath? Pouches?)
- [ ] How do dropped villager garments interact with brass jackets visually?
- [ ] Timing map: Who transforms first (spark)? Who transforms last (seal)?

## Uniform Drop Concept

### The Vision

~96 garments on the field at the end of the show:
- 64 brass jackets (white, structured)
- ~32 guard over-layers (earth tones)

**Thematic meaning:** Worker solidarity memorial — the corps sheds what they were to become what they're crossing into.

### Spatial Arrangement

**Option A: Scattered Organic**
- Garments fall where members stand during transformation
- Creates organic, "aftermath" look
- Easier to execute (no precise placement)

**Option B: Collected/Shaped**
- Garments arranged in specific pattern
- Creates visual design element
- Requires more precise choreography

**Option C: Piled Ritual**
- Garments gathered to specific location
- Creates focal point (altar, memorial)
- Requires additional movement after removal

**Current Leaning:** Option A with precision elements — scattered but with intentional "horns out" orientation for jackets.

### Open Questions
- [ ] Field arrangement pattern finalized?
- [ ] Do garments stay through entire exit sequence?
- [ ] Who collects garments post-show? (Props crew? Members?)
- [ ] Storage during exit? (Left on field until corps clears?)

## Hut Mechanics

### Walking Mechanism

**Current Design:**
- Da Vinci walking machine concept
- Two performers inside animate legs
- Uses performer weight, not motors

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] How do performers enter/exit Hut during show?
- [ ] Visibility for performers inside (mesh panels? Viewing slots?)
- [ ] Communication between Hut performers and DM/staff?

### Transformation to Gate Backdrop

**Current Design:**
- Hut "unrolls" into full Great Gate silk backdrop
- Large silk, full-span, dramatic

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] Is this a mechanical transformation or manual unfurling?
- [ ] Who operates the unfurling? (Hut performers? Props crew? Guard?)
- [ ] Timing relative to stillness/transformation ritual?

---

## DM Costume

### Current Assumption
- DM remains in full whites throughout
- Only face visible during stillness (everyone else in balaclavas)
- Creates visual focal point

### Open Questions
- [ ] Does DM participate in any shedding? (Hat removal at exit — yes. Jacket? No?)
- [ ] DM balaclava: Does DM have one but not use it? Or not have one at all?
- [ ] Hat placement at 10-yard line: Same hat worn all show, or ceremonial replacement?

---

## Brass Reveal

### What's Underneath?

When brass removes white jackets, what do they reveal?

**Option A: Plain Black**
- Black long-sleeve athletic shirts
- Black balaclavas
- Total anonymity — faceless, uniform

**Option B: Embroidered Vests**
- Black base with subtle embroidery
- Slavic-inspired patterns
- More visual interest, but more expensive

**Option C: Simple Undershirts**
- Basic black t-shirts or tanks
- Balaclavas for face
- Cheapest, most anonymous

**Current Leaning:** Option A (black athletic shirts + balaclavas) — anonymous, affordable, creates stark contrast.

### Open Questions
- [ ] Final decision on underlayer aesthetic?
- [ ] Balaclava material (cotton? moisture-wicking? mesh for breathing?)
- [ ] Do all 64 brass look identical, or any variation?

## Phoenix Flag Logistics

### Manipulation Sequence

1. **Start Position:** Bundled at back of formation, held by 6-10 guard
2. **Release:** Guard releases, flag begins to unfurl
3. **Travel:** Flag travels over corps (front to back or back to front?)
4. **Collapse:** Flag settles at front of formation
5. **Exit:** DM/Handler interacts with collapsed silk

### Open Questions
- [ ] Direction of travel: Front-to-back or back-to-front?
- [ ] How many guard members needed for manipulation?
- [ ] Does flag "die" (collapse naturally) or is it "killed" (pulled down)?
- [ ] Wind contingency: What if wind catches it wrong?

## Stillness Training

### Physical Requirements

42 measures of motionless standing requires:
- Sustainable posture (no drift)
- Controlled breathing (no visible chest movement)
- Fixed eye focus (looking at center, not wandering)
- Balanced weight distribution

### Training Approach (Monte)

1. **Posture drills:** Finding sustainable alignment
2. **Breath work:** Diaphragmatic breathing, invisible expansion
3. **Eye training:** Soft focus, peripheral awareness
4. **Endurance building:** Gradually increasing hold times

### Open Questions
- [ ] How much time allocated in spring camps for stillness training?
- [ ] Integration with regular visual rehearsal or separate track?
- [ ] Assessment criteria: How do we know when it's "clean enough"?
