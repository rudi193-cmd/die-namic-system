# Prototype Plan

**"THE GATE"**
*Build Schedule & Specifications*

---

## Overview

All major props and costumes go through phased prototype development before full production commitment. This de-risks the project and ensures designs work in practice, not just on paper.

## Decision Points

### After Each Phase

1. Review deliverables
2. Identify issues
3. Decide: proceed / modify / abandon
4. Document learnings

### Final GO/NO-GO (End of April)

**Criteria for GO:**
- All prototypes function reliably
- Timing achievable
- Costs within budget
- Safety confirmed
- Corps partnership secured

**If NO-GO:**
- Identify specific blockers
- Determine if solvable
- Adjust timeline or scope
- Communicate transparently with corps
