# Prototype Plan

**"THE GATE"**
*Pre-Production Testing & Development*

---

## Overview

Before corps commits to full production, prototypes allow testing of critical elements. The Albuquerque creative team will build and test these prototypes, providing proof-of-concept before significant budget allocation.

**Total Prototype Budget:** $2,350 – $3,900

---

## The Hut

### Phase 2: Full-Scale Non-Animated

**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks
**Cost:** $300-$500

**Objectives:**

- Verify weight is manageable for two performers
- Test visibility for performers inside
- Assess visual impact at field scale

**Deliverables:**
- Full-scale static structure
- Weight measurements
- Performer feedback on interior experience
- Photos/video at distance (simulating audience view)

### Phase 3: Full-Scale Animated

**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
**Cost:** $600-$900

**Objectives:**
- Integrate walking mechanism
- Test performer training requirements
- Verify stability during movement
- Test transformation to Gate backdrop (if applicable)

**Deliverables:**
- Fully functional walking Hut
- Training documentation
- Video of movement sequences
- GO/NO-GO recommendation

**Total Hut Prototype:** $950-$1,500

## Phoenix Flag

### Purpose
Test fabric weight, flow characteristics, color impact, and manipulation requirements.

### Phase 1: Quarter-Scale (15 yards)

**Timeline:** 2 weeks
**Cost:** $100-$200

**Objectives:**
- Test fabric weight and drape
- Experiment with gradient dying
- Assess flow characteristics
- Determine edge treatment needs

**Deliverables:**
- 15-yard test flag
- Color samples (fire gradient vs. earth tones)
- Flow video
- Notes on fabric selection

### Phase 2: Half-Scale (30 yards)

**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks
**Cost:** $400-$700

**Objectives:**
- Test manipulation with multiple handlers
- Verify release and travel mechanics
- Assess collapse behavior
- Test wind resistance

**Deliverables:**
- 30-yard functional flag
- Manipulation video with 3-5 handlers
- Wind testing results
- Personnel requirements finalized

**Total Phoenix Prototype:** $500-$900

---

## Guard Costumes

### Purpose
Test quick-change mechanics, timing, visual impact of transformation.

### Single Costume Prototype

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Cost:** $150-$250

**Objectives:**
- Test snap tape release at spine
- Verify tear-away construction holds during performance
- Time the transformation sequence
- Assess visual impact of revealed costume

**Deliverables:**
- One complete transformation costume (female)
- Video of quick-change sequence
- Timing data
- Modifications needed

### Five-Costume Sample Set

**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks (after single prototype)
**Cost:** $750-$1,250

**Objectives:**
- Test multiple performers in sequence
- Verify staggered timing looks organic
- Assess color palette at scale
- Test male version construction

**Deliverables:**
- 3 female + 2 male transformation costumes
- Staggered transformation video
- Color recommendations
- Production specification document

**Total Guard Prototype:** $900-$1,500

---

## Brass Jacket Prototype

### Purpose
Test snap tape release, jacket placement, visual of "horns out" pattern.

### Not Separately Budgeted

**Rationale:**
- Many corps have existing jacket inventory
- Modification (adding snap tape) may be sufficient
- Single prototype can be built from existing jacket + modifications

**If Needed:** $100-$200 for single prototype jacket with snap tape front closure.

## Testing Protocol

### Each Prototype Phase Includes:

1. **Build documentation** — Materials list, construction notes, time required
2. **Functional testing** — Does it work as designed?
3. **Stress testing** — What breaks? Where are the weak points?
4. **Video documentation** — Multiple angles, distance shots
5. **Performer feedback** — Comfort, visibility, confidence
6. **Cost analysis** — Actual vs. estimated costs
7. **GO/NO-GO recommendation** — Proceed or pivot?

### Decision Points

| Date | Decision |
|------|----------|
| Feb 28 | Hut Phase 1 complete — proceed to Phase 2? |
| Mar 10 | Phoenix Phase 1 complete — proceed to Phase 2? |
| Mar 15 | Guard single prototype complete — proceed to 5-set? |
| **Mar 20** | **MASTER GO/NO-GO** — All prototypes reviewed |

## Budget Summary

| Item | Low | High |
|------|-----|------|
| Hut (3 phases) | $950 | $1,500 |
| Phoenix (2 phases) | $500 | $900 |
| Guard (single + 5-set) | $900 | $1,500 |
| **TOTAL** | **$2,350** | **$3,900** |

## Team Assignments

| Prototype | Lead | Support |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Hut | Sean + Props volunteer | Monte (testing) |
| Phoenix | Caitlin (color) | Guard staff (manipulation) |
| Guard Costumes | Johnny | Caitlin (color consultation) |

## Risk Mitigation

### If Hut Prototype Fails
- **Pivot:** Static Hut (no walking mechanism)
- **Pivot:** Simpler backdrop-only structure
- **Cost saved:** $300-$600 (no animated mechanism)

### If Phoenix Prototype Fails
- **Pivot:** Smaller flags (traditional guard work)
- **Pivot:** Multiple medium flags instead of single large
- **Cost saved:** $200-$400

### If Guard Costume Fails
- **Pivot:** Simpler transformation (layer removal only, no tear-away)
- **Pivot:** Section-by-section transformation (not full guard)
- **Cost saved:** $1,000-$2,000
