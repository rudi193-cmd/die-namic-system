- Generic solutions (not show-specific)

### Albuquerque Network Approach
- Local talent (lower cost, higher availability)
- Personal relationships (accountability)
- Invested in success (not just billing hours)
- Can iterate quickly (same-day meetings)

**Result:** Better work, lower cost, faster turnaround.

3. Kick-off meeting with full team
4. Assign prototype responsibilities
5. Begin development
