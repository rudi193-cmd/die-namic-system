## Why This Team Matters

Traditional drum corps consultants come from drum corps backgrounds. This team brings **unconventional expertise**:

- **Burlesque** → Quick-change mastery that guard staff don't have
- **Martial arts** → Stillness discipline that drill instructors don't teach
- **Hollywood VFX** → Production quality that corps can't usually access
- **Fine arts** → Color and composition expertise beyond typical design staff

The show's innovations require innovative expertise. This team has it.

## Next Steps

1. Finalize engagement with David Valdez, Dan Gutierrez, Rich Black
2. Coordinate prototype development timeline with confirmed team
3. Establish communication channels (shared folder, group chat)
4. Define deliverables and compensation for each role
