## Design Intention

A ritual-myth field production about transformation, fearlessness, legacy, and the crossing from childhood into mythic adulthood.

---

## Corps Configuration

**DCI Standard (max 165)**

| Section | Count | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Brass | 64 | 8×8 Square (16 each: Tpt, Mello, Bari, Tuba) |
| Battery | ~30 | Snares, tenors, bass, cymbals |
| Pit | ~12 | Mallets, synth, auxiliary |
| Guard | ~32 | Standard + 60-yard Phoenix silk |
| DM | 1 | Plus Assistant DM for staging |

---

## The Dual-Version Architecture

### Season Shows (Weeks 1-12)
- Traditional DCI aesthetic
- Corps in white jackets
- Flowing, curved drill during both movements
- Dog gag at the end (playful, crowd-pleasing)
- DM exits with corps

### Finals Show (Championship Night Only)
- 15-20 second transformation ritual between movements
- Corps removes white jackets, reveals earth tones/black beneath
- ~96 garments left on field as worker memorial
- Brass stands MOTIONLESS for 42 measures during Great Gate
- Mellophone/trumpet parts swap
- Interwoven brass grid (B-M-T-Tu pattern)
- No dog — Handler retrieves toy, hesitates, takes it offstage
- DM's final exit: salute, hat on 10-yard line, 7/4 march off alone

---

## I. PRE-SHOW | Whispered Ritual

**Season Shows:**
- Corps enters normally in whites
- Assembles into square formation
- Announcer begins

**Finals Show:**
- Corps enters in whites (looks identical to season)
- Assembles into square formation
- 10-15 second delay
- Members whisper to each other: *"Tonight… the Gate is waiting…"*
- Announcer begins

---

## II. OPENING FORMATION (All Season)

Corps assembles into a perfect 8×8 square perimeter — but the interior is empty.

- 64 brass fill the walls of the box ("The Square")
- Battery in the center, facing backfield
- Guard spread along outer edges, drifting like spirits
- **Four corners always anchored** — every page of drill includes someone in those four spots

---

## III. SHOW STARTS DURING ANNOUNCEMENT

Battery begins the first Baba Yaga heartbeat cadence **before the announcer finishes**.

- Unconventional — most corps wait
- Creates unease
- Brass maintain perfect stillness
- Crowd feels the tension

---

## IV. BABA YAGA AWAKENS (Hut Movement)

**Music:** The Hut on Hen's Legs

### Visual Points:
- The Hut structure (silk + PVC, lightweight) begins to twitch after the first brass blast
- Two performers (Baba Yaga + Assistant) enter the Hut and animate it like a Da Vinci walking machine
- Rotating vortex drill:
  - Brass square remains intact (four corners always anchored)
  - Guard creates clockwise ring
  - Battery creates counterclockwise ring

### Drill Character:
- "A string thrown at paper" — chaotic, free-flowing
- Blue Knights-style curved paths
- High demand, high energy, constant motion
- **But the four corners always hold**

### Myth Moment:
- Assistant tries to "warn the world" → plays an E♭ on glockenspiel out of sync
- Drum major descends from podium, guides her back
- The Hut receives her

---

## V. THE QUIET CRISIS (Percussion Reflection)

A non-traditional "drum break" — NOT full battery, NOT a stop in the music.

Just the natural lull in the brass texture, where:
- Glockenspiel (E♭)
- Woodblocks
- Anvils
- Shakers
- Frame drums

...paint Baba Yaga's inside world.

**Guard Transformation (Finals):**
- Quick-change to Slavic layers
- Staggered, organic — an "awakening" that ripples across the field
- Not synchronized — some fast, some slow, some alone, some in pairs
- Map: who transforms first (the "spark"), who transforms last (the "seal")

---

## VI. VORTEX + TRIAL (The Crossing)

The triangle + ring pattern emerges:
- Outer ring (guard) rotates counterclockwise
- Middle ring (battery) rotates clockwise
- Brass square fractures into a rotating triangle
- Assistant attempts escape
- DM forces her return
- Hut stands tall on stilt-legs (the Da Vinci mechanism fully awakens)

**This is the peak of chaos.**

---

## VII. SILENCE (Finals Only: 15-20 Seconds)

**Season Shows:**
- Brief transition
- Great Gate begins immediately

**Finals Show:**
- All stop
- Baba Yaga freezes
- The Hut leans forward
- Brass turn inward
- **15-20 second silence** (not 5 — this is the transformation window)

### The 51-Count Transformation Ritual:

| Counts | Action |
|--------|--------|
| 1-17 | Instruments down — slow, deliberate, surrendering the thing that makes sound |
| 18-34 | Jacket removal — the outer layer comes off, what was hidden is revealed |
| 35-51 | Jacket placement, hat placement, and final 6 counts: retrieval of instruments + sharp turn to center |

**Count 52:** Set at attention
**Counts 53-72:** Five measures of 4/4 stillness (20 counts)

**Total:** 72 counts — always π away from primes when divided

### The Visual Result:
- 64 white jackets in straight lines along the perimeter
- 64 hats placed between performers' feet (45° angle, first/second position)
- 64 faceless figures in all-black (long-sleeve athletic shirts + balaclavas)
- DM alone in full whites, elevated on center podium
- ~96 garments total on field (brass + guard) — worker solidarity memorial

---

## VIII. THE GATE (Great Gate of Kiev)

### Season Version:
- Traditional brass arcs
- Guard flourishes
- Normal crescendos
- Full corps returns to conventional staging
- Dog gag appears at the end

### Finals Version:

**1. Mellophone Opening Feature**
- Trumpet + mello parts swapped for opening measures
- Mello warmth signals transformation
- Learned organically all season (singing on bus, noodling in tunnels)

**2. Brass Interwoven Pattern**
- B–M–T–Tu repeating across the 8×8 grid
- Creates a living harmonic field
- Every yard line has all four voices represented
- Individual caption judges cannot isolate their sections

**3. The Stillness**
- Brass stands MOTIONLESS for 42 measures
- Facing center
- Guard and battery continue their normal choreography inside
- The ONLY change to drill is brass stops moving

**4. Sacred Geometry Drill**
- All formations use only four angles: 90°, 45°, 33°, 72°
- 90° and 45° = stability, structure, the known world
- 72° and 33° = ritual, tension, the crossing
- 33° creates unease — 33 vertebrae in the human spine

**5. Gate Unfurling**
- The Hut unrolls into the full Great Gate backdrop
- Large silk, full-span, dramatic but natural

**6. Two Backfield Rows**
- The 64 brass split into two rows of 32, stretching across the back hash
- This forms "The Gate"

**7. The Turn (Measure 43)**
- Brass slowly, synchronously rotates to face AUDIENCE
- Takes approximately 8 measures
- The Gate now faces forward; what was contained is now revealed

**8. The Phoenix Moment**
- 60-yard silk Phoenix erupts from back perimeter
- Travels over the entire corps
- Collapses at the front
- Season: DM retrieves toy from collapse
- Finals: Handler retrieves toy

---

## IX. EXIT | The Sacrifice

### Season Shows:
- Phoenix collapses
- DM walks to collapse point, retrieves toy
- Dog (who's been chilling by the pit) sees the toy
- Dog wanders over, playful chaos ensues
- DM and dog exit together toward tunnel
- Crowd loves it

### Finals Show:

1. Phoenix unfurls and collapses (same blocking)
2. **Handler** walks to retrieve the toy (not DM)
3. Handler places toy near where DM will stand
4. Handler hesitates (2-3 seconds — visual moment of choice)
5. Handler picks it back up, carries it offstage toward props/pit
6. Corps condenses into exit formation (two lines)
7. DM joins at front corner (65 total)
8. March toward back hash
9. **DM stops at 10-yard line** (corps continues)
10. **Full drum major salute** — the perfected one, first time audience sees it complete
11. DM removes hat, places it on ground
12. Crisp about-face
13. **DM marches off alone in 7/4 time**
14. Hat remains alone on the 10-yard back hash
15. **Offstage eruption** — celebration from tunnel

---

## X. THE THREE CHANGES (Season → Finals)

| Element | Season | Finals |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **The Dog** | Present, playful exit | Absent — Handler takes toy offstage |
| **Brass Drill** | Flowing, moving | Motionless for 42 measures (Great Gate only) |
| **Mello/Trumpet Parts** | Standard voicing | Complete swap (Great Gate only) |

**Everything else stays identical:** guard choreography, battery staging, Baba Yaga drill, Phoenix flag, music.

---

## XI. FINALS-ONLY ADDITIONS

- Interleaved brass formation (B–M–T–Tu pattern)
- 15-20 second transformation ritual
- 51-count kata (instruments down → jacket removal → placement → retrieval)
- All-black uniforms + balaclavas revealed
- ~96 garments left on field as worker memorial
- DM podium used mid-show (center of square)
- DM's final salute at the 10
- DM marches off alone in 7/4
- Ritual silence emphasized
- Sacred geometry drill vocabulary (four angles only)

---

## XII. THEMATIC LAYERS

### Surface Level
Mythic journey: chaos (Baba Yaga) → transformation → arrival (The Gate)

### Historical Framing
Industrial Revolution adoption in Slavic regions (Croatia, Slovenia, Bohemia, Galicia). Folk identity colliding with factory life. The Gate is both mythic passage and factory gate / immigration checkpoint.

### Worker Solidarity
~96 uniforms left on the field. The corps sheds what they were to become what they're crossing into. The dropped garments are a memorial — workers who passed through, the ones who came before.

### The Unseen Ones
The four corners that anchor every page of drill. The frame that never breaks. The structure that holds even when chaos swirls inside it.

### Sacred Mathematics
- 72 = always π away from primes
- 51 = 17 + 17 + 17 (trinitarian kata)
- 42 = measures of stillness
- 4 = sacred angles (90°, 45°, 33°, 72°)
- 64 + 1 = 65 (DM joins corps) → 6 + 5 = 11 (prime)

---

## XIII. THE DOG

Not a trained performance animal — just a staff member's dog who became family.

- Travels with corps all season (ideal)
- Chills by the pit during shows
- Season shows: wanders over to DM after finale, playful chaos
- Finals: absent — Handler retrieves her toy, hesitates, takes it offstage
- The toy makes a sound (bell/rattle) that everyone knows but no one hears from 50 yards away
- The absence of the dog is the absence of joy that costs nothing
