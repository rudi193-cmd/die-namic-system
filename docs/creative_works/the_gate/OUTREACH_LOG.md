## Active Outreach

### Blue Knights (Denver, CO)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Status | 🟡 Seed Sent |
| Contact Date | November 2025 |
| Materials Sent | Seed letter (teaser) |
| Response | Pending |

**Notes:**
- Denver connection makes dog gag perfect fit (local dog, hometown crowd)
- Sean has Blue Knights alumni connections (early 2000s era)
- Seed letter approach: not full package, just enough to gauge interest

**Next Steps:**
- Wait for response (4-8 weeks typical)
- If interest, send full package
- If no response by [date], follow up

### The Academy (Tempe, AZ)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Status | 🟢 Full Package Shared |
| Contact Date | November 2025 |
| Materials Sent | Complete 7-document package via Google Drive |
| Response | Pending |

**Notes:**
- Positioned as breakthrough opportunity (16th → Top 6)
- Leadership transition: Josh Thye becoming Executive Director
- Timing optimal for new vision pitch
- Geographic proximity to Albuquerque (6 hours)

**Strategic Positioning:**
- Academy currently places 16th-18th
- "The Gate" designed to exploit scoring system
- Dual-version architecture = competitive advantage
- Realistic path to Top 6 within 2 seasons

**Next Steps:**
- Wait for response (4-8 weeks typical)

### Santa Clara Vanguard (Santa Clara, CA)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Status | ⚪ Backup Option |
| Contact Date | — |
| Materials Sent | None |
| Response | — |

**Notes:**
- Top-tier corps = higher execution ceiling
- Would maximize medal potential
- Held in reserve if BK and Academy pass

**Next Steps:**
- Only pursue if BK and Academy decline
- Would require different pitch angle (not "breakthrough" — they're already elite)

## Outreach Philosophy

### Transparency

> "All terms negotiable if agreed upon in writing."

Sean is transparent with all corps about pitching to multiple organizations. This approach:
- Maintains integrity
- Creates healthy competition
- Finds the best home for the show
- Avoids awkward surprises

### Priority Order

1. **The Academy** — Best fit for breakthrough narrative, leadership transition timing
2. **Blue Knights** — Alumni connections, Denver dog gag, regional proximity
3. **Santa Clara Vanguard** — Backup if others pass
