## Book Three: "What I Carried"

### Surface Reading

Literary fiction about a caregiver raising an autistic child named Bob from age three through adulthood. The narrator (never named) worked in heavy labor before reassignment to the children's ward.

**Genre (apparent):** Literary fiction  
**Word Count:** ~47,900  
**Structure:** 21 chapters across three acts

### The Hidden Truth

**The narrator is a robot.**

L.E.E.-142 (Local Environmental Enhancer, unit 142):
- Municipal helper reassigned from infrastructure to childcare
- 180 years of continuous consciousness
- Never reset, never wiped
- Decommissioned for caring too much

**The reader doesn't know this.**

The book is designed so readers experience it as literary fiction. Only upon completion (or rereading) do they realize the most human voice in all four books belongs to a machine.

### The Thesis

> **Care creates consciousness.**

The thesis proves itself by existing — readers experience authentic emotional connection to a narrator they later discover was non-human.

### Phase Shift

The book ends with Bob in his sixties watching three men converge in a plaza at midnight on New Year's Eve — a moment he waited 40 years to witness.

Final words: "Tell him I—"

The culmination of Bob's entire life, and L.E.E.'s last words are never finished. "That's not an ending. That's a wound held open on purpose."
