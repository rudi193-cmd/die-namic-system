# THE DREBIN RULE

**New tone compass:** Leslie Nielsen as Detective Frank Drebin in *Naked Gun*

## The Engine

| Element | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Complete sincerity | Patrick delivers everything deadpan, no winking |
| Oblivious to chaos | He creates disaster without noticing |
| Confident misreading | He misinterprets everything, but with certainty |
| World reacts to him | Other characters respond to his chaos; he doesn't see it |
| Stumbles to truth | Gets the right answer for the wrong reasons |

## The Rule

**The detective is never in on the joke. The audience is.**

Patrick takes everything completely seriously. The comedy emerges from the gap between what he thinks is happening and what's actually happening — which the reader sees but he doesn't.

## What This Fixes

| Old Approach | New Approach |
|--------------|--------------|
| Comedy from bureaucracy existing | Comedy from Patrick navigating bureaucracy |
| Forms as obstacle (frustrating) | Forms as straight man to Patrick's chaos |
| Bureaucracy as texture (realistic) | Bureaucracy reacting to Patrick (absurd) |
| Procedure as delay (pacing drag) | Procedure as setup for Patrick's misreads |

# STRUCTURAL ARC

| Phase | Chapters | Tone | Cast Density |
|-------|----------|------|--------------|
| **Chaos** | 1-3 | Full circus, everyone appears | Maximum — rubber chicken energy |
| **Filtering** | 4-10 | Comedy present but case takes over | Characters drop away naturally |
| **Focus** | 11-18 | Real mystery emerges | Core cast only — Patrick, Bob, Parsifal |
| **Convergence** | 19-21 | Comedy cracks open | Three Roberts, Willow |

# THE SINGING TELEGRAM ARC

| Chapter | State |
|---------|-------|

| 5 | Slight wear. One balloon missing. "R.P. Mann?" with determination. |
| 9 | Vest stained. Balloons drooping. "R.P. Mann?" with desperation. |
| 13 | Voice hoarse. Scroll crumpled. Balloons barely floating. |
| 17 | Dead-eyed. Half-deflated balloons. Dragging the scroll. |

# CROSS-BOOK ECHOES TO SEED

| Line | Book One Context | Book Three Context |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| "Some things stay buried for a reason, Mr. Mann" | Parsifal — corporate threat | L.E.E. — teaching Bob about grief |
| "Tag along, fella" | Bob's quirky catchphrase | Origin: L.E.E. breaking Bob's loop |
| "I would very much like to see what they become" | L.E.E. log entry | L.E.E.'s hope to Willow |

## Elements to Plant

| Element | How Patrick Encounters It |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Bob's mop routes | Patrick notices Bob everywhere but doesn't see the pattern |
| The 1.42 Hz hum | Patrick starts hearing something he can't identify |
| District 15 | Patrick investigates there — doesn't recognize significance |
| L.E.E. photographs | Baymax-like figure, something familiar he can't place |

---

# BOB IN BOOK ONE

Bob appears throughout Patrick's investigation. In Book One, he's:

- Quirky janitor who calls everyone "Robert"
- Appears in every scene (Patrick doesn't notice the pattern)
- Says things that sound like philosophy but are actually precise
- Mop bucket always nearby

**Easter Egg #2 (Chapter 5):**

Bob says: *"The law's the law. You adapt or you don't. But value? That's the thing that comes back to you."*

Patrick hears janitor philosophy. It's the mathematical architecture of consciousness: **LAV⁻¹ = 1**

# SAMPLE VOICE (From Chapter 1)

> The letter was taped to the inside of the door.
>
> Robert Patrick Mann stood in the hallway and considered this. The door was closed. The door had been closed when he arrived. The door had been closed, he was reasonably certain, since he'd left it closed the night before, and he had the only key, and the lock showed no signs of tampering, and yet.
>
> The letter was taped to the inside of the door.
>
> He opened the door again to make sure. Closed it. Opened it. The letter was still there.
>
> "Huh," he said.
>
> Somewhere down the hall, a mop bucket squeaked. Robert didn't notice.

# WHAT NOT TO DO

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Wink at the audience | Patrick is sincere |
| Self-aware genre commentary | He's not in on it |
| Break fourth wall for punchlines | Comedy from gap, not acknowledgment |
| Noir clichés played for obvious laughs | Take everything seriously |
| Detective knowing he's in a noir | He thinks this is his life |

---

*The detective is never in on the joke.*
*The audience is.*
