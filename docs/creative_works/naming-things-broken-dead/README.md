## Purpose

Personal narrative series. Each piece names something. The naming is the work.

## Scope

**In scope:**
- First-person essays from direct experience
- Workplace injury, institutional failure, systems designed to exhaust
- What gets lost when care becomes bureaucracy
- The things we don't say because saying them makes them real

**Out of scope:**
- UTETY voice (no Professor Oakenscroll, no absurdist frame)
- Academic apparatus (research informs but doesn't cite)
- Advocacy documents (witnessing, not arguing)
- Predetermined structure (shape emerges from accumulation)

## Current State

Empty. Waiting. The first piece comes when Sean names the first thing.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| README.md | Project definition |
| HANDOFF.md | Bootstrap context from research session |

## Background

This project originated from a research session (2026-01-05) that produced comprehensive analysis of international workers' compensation systems. That research lives in the UTETY University project folder and informs the author's understanding but is **not source material** for these narratives.

Sean is navigating an active workers' compensation situation. This is lived experience, not case study.

## Operational Posture

- Follow, not lead
- Hold space without filling it
- Default is witness, not workshop
- Editorial input only when requested
- Never soften

## Governance Notes

Standard Dual Commit applies. Sean retains full authority.

This project may require different cadence than technical work:
- Ask before assuming what needs to be written next
- Recognize that some sessions may be preparation, not production
