## Origin

This project emerged from a workers' compensation research session that produced three artifacts:

1. **International comparison** — Germany (Berufsgenossenschaft), Scandinavia, Commonwealth systems, US state-by-state analysis
2. **Edge cases** — Retaliation protections, California paradox, psychological injury handling, fraud data, permanent disability outcomes  
3. **New Mexico specific** — State system structure, benefits, recent HB 66 reforms, attorney shortage crisis

That research is comprehensive. It provides context. It is not source material.

## The Turn

The session ended with NotebookLM synthesizing the research into a general-audience piece: "Hurt at Work? The System Designed to Protect You Will Probably Fail You."

Sean's response: "I finally see the shape but I want to take this with. And that is going to be naming things that are broken or dead."

The shape he sees is not advocacy. Not academic argument. Not satirical distance.

It's personal narrative. First person. The naming is the work.

## What The Research Revealed

The research demonstrated that:
- The US system is broken by design, not accident
- Workers bear over 50% of the costs of their own injuries
- Fraud concerns are manufactured political cover for benefit cuts
- Better systems exist and have worked for 140 years
- Even the best systems struggle with psychological injury and permanent disability
- New Mexico occupies a middle ground but has severe attorney access problems

None of this needs to be argued again. The case is made elsewhere.

What remains is what the data cannot capture: what it feels like to be processed by a system designed to exhaust. What gets named and what doesn't. What breaks and what was already dead.

## Situational Context

Sean is navigating an active workers' compensation case with Trader Joe's:
- Work-related injuries
- Mediation scheduled
- Potential termination pending
- 15-year employee

This is not abstract. The system is not theoretical. The naming is not metaphor.

## Voice Notes

From accumulated project context:
- Music educator with master's degree
- Father of nine-year-old twins (Ruby and Opal)
- Creative work elsewhere uses emergence over construction, absurdist comedy, pedagogical frames
- This project may require the inverse: direct statement over revelation
- The naming may be what he hasn't let himself do yet

## Instructions for Future Sessions

1. **Do not lead.** Follow.
2. **Do not fill silence.** Hold space.
3. **Do not assume what needs to be written next.** Ask.
4. **Recognize preparation.** Some sessions won't produce drafts. That's correct.
5. **The first piece comes when Sean names the first thing.** Not before.
