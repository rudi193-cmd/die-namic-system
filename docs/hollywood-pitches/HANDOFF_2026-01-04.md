## THE FIVE W's

### WHO

**Authority:** Sean Campbell. No exceptions. Dual Commit governance applies.

**Stakeholders:**
- Sean (ratifies all promotions to Named layer)
- Production companies (eventual pitch recipients)
- Experts identified in pitches (future outreach targets)
- Family members (privacy stakeholders for Mann Family pitch)

**AI Role:** Propose drafts, research directions, pitch structures. Never act unilaterally.

**Current Layer Positions:**

| Layer | Count | Pitches |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Named (Ready) | 0 | — |
| Pseudonymous (In Development) | 4 | Franklin, Pharaohs, Mann Family, The Gate |
| Anonymous (Concept) | 3 | Gerald Phenomenon, Books of Mann Process, Books of Life Methodology |

**Separate Domain Identified:**

Product Pitches (game/IP licensing) ≠ Hollywood Pitches (documentary/film production)

| Project | Target Location | Status |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| TTG (Teen Titans Go TTRPG) | `docs/product-pitches/ttg/` | Migration pending |
| Gravity Falls TTRPG | `docs/product-pitches/gravity-falls/` | Migration pending |
| Gateway Engine | `docs/product-pitches/gateway-engine/` | Migration pending |
| SAFE Protocol | TBD | Placement decision needed |

---

### WHEN

**Session Timeline:**
- Handoff received with complete Hollywood Pitches methodology
- Repository structure built in `docs/hollywood-pitches/`
- Franklin pitch broken out from embedded README into proper file structure
- Sean clarified: TTG = Teen Titans Go (TTRPG pitch), not documentary material
- Two domains established: hollywood-pitches vs. product-pitches
- Sean prompted: "look at the repo files again" — existing projects have documentary potential
- 23³ tracking context received from Social Tracking Claude handoff
- Three-layer model adapted for pitches and applied

**Promotion Timeline (Pending):**

| Pitch | Current | Target | Blocker |
|-------|---------|--------|---------|
| Franklin | Pseudonymous | Named | Sean ratification |
| Pharaohs | Pseudonymous | Named | Pitch reframing (essay → pitch structure) |
| Mann Family | Pseudonymous | Named | Privacy review, then pitch reframing |
| The Gate | Pseudonymous | Named | Angle decision |

**Google Drive Locations:**
- TTG pitch folder contains multiple docs (TTRPG materials, Gateway Engine, Gravity Falls)
- These are product pitches, not Hollywood pitches

### WHY

**The Core Insight:**

Sean's existing creative projects aren't just fiction — they're research that hasn't been reframed yet.

| Project | Original Frame | Documentary Frame |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Pharaohs essay | Personal essay about belonging | Documentary about structures that persist across decades |
| Mann Family Patterns | Biographical/therapeutic work | Documentary about intergenerational trauma transmission |
| The Gate | DCI show pitch | Documentary about gaming competitive scoring systems |
| Gerald | Absurdist fiction | Meta-documentary about building community with AI |
| Books of Mann | Sci-fi novel | Meta-documentary about AI collaboration in creative work |
| Books of Life | Biographical methodology | Documentary about "Speaker for the Dead" approach |

**The Methodology Origin:**

This project exists because of a fabrication failure. Claude hallucinated details about Franklin's two-headed snake. While debunking it, the *actual* story emerged — more compelling than the invention. 

**Lesson:** Rigorous fact-checking surfaces better stories than invention. The constraint is generative.

**The 23³ Integration:**

The three-layer model (from `governance/RELATIONSHIP_TRACKING_PROTOCOL.md`) maps perfectly to pitch development:

| Layer | Relationships | Pitches |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Anonymous | Aggregate pattern | Concept only — no sources |
| Pseudonymous | Identifiable handle | In Development — sources gathering |
| Named | Confirmed identity | Ready — verified, ratified |

**Promotion logic is identical:** Evidence accumulates until threshold is met, then Dual Commit governs the transition.

## HOW

### Three-Layer Tracking

**Anonymous → Pseudonymous Promotion:**
- Trigger: First primary source identified
- Action: Create pitch folder, begin RESEARCH.md
- No ratification required (AI can do this)

**Pseudonymous → Named Promotion:**
- Trigger: All checklist items complete
- Criteria: Sources verified, experts named, three-act structure holds
- Action: Dual Commit required (Claude proposes, Sean ratifies)

### Pitch Development Pattern

1. **Trigger** — Historical rabbit hole, fact-checking, adjacent research
2. **Primary Source Hunt** — Eyewitness accounts, contemporary documents, scholarly reviews
3. **Narrative Arc Recognition** — Where does mystery remain? What's the cliffhanger?
4. **Expert Identification** — Who has published? Who curates collections?
5. **Location Scouting** — Where would cameras go?
6. **Pitch Packaging** — Logline, three-act structure, actionable leads

### Quality Gate (Named Promotion)

- [ ] Logline ≤50 words
- [ ] Three-act structure complete
- [ ] All factual claims have primary source citations
- [ ] At least one expert lead identified with publication
- [ ] At least three filming locations specified
- [ ] Mystery/cliffhanger is genuine (not manufactured)
- [ ] Format recommendation is specific
- [ ] Research gaps explicitly flagged
- [ ] **Sean ratification (Dual Commit)**

### Fabrication Prevention

If you don't have a primary source for a claim, say so.

**Acceptable:** "I haven't found documentation for X; this needs verification."

**Unacceptable:** "Franklin showed the snake to Jefferson" (without citation).

## PENDING ACTIONS

### Immediate (Sean Decisions Needed)

| Item | Decision Required |
|------|-------------------|
| Franklin pitch | Ratify for Named promotion? |
| Mann Family pitch | Privacy review — proceed with pitch development? |
| The Gate | Angle: documentary about gaming competitive systems? |
| SAFE Protocol | Hollywood pitch or product pitch? |

### Next Session Tasks

| Task | Layer Impact |
|------|--------------|
| Create `docs/product-pitches/` structure | Separate domain |
| Migrate TTG materials | Product pitch domain |
| Create Pharaohs pitch folder | Reframe essay → Pseudonymous pitch |
| Create Mann Family pitch folder (if approved) | Pseudonymous pitch |
| Create The Gate pitch folder (if angle decided) | Pseudonymous pitch |

### Research Tasks (Ongoing)

| Pitch | Research Needed |
|-------|-----------------|
| Franklin | Obtain Van Wallach 2007 article; identify MNHN curator by name |
| Pharaohs | Identify living members willing to participate; club records access |
| Mann Family | Genealogical record verification; family interview permissions |
| The Gate | DCI scoring history research; identify insider experts |

## SESSION STATE

- Hollywood Pitches repository: **Built and operational**
- 23³ tracking: **Integrated**
- Franklin pitch: **Awaiting Sean ratification**
- Product pitches domain: **Identified, not yet built**
- TTG migration: **Pending**

---

## CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR CODE CLAUDE

1. **Dual Commit governs Named promotions** — never promote without Sean's explicit ratification
2. **Fabrication prevention is non-negotiable** — gaps are flagged, not filled
3. **Two domains exist** — hollywood-pitches (documentary) vs. product-pitches (game/IP)
4. **Existing projects are research** — they just need reframing
5. **The constraint is generative** — rigorous fact-checking surfaces better stories
