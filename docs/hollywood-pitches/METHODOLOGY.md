## The Pattern

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 1. Trigger | Historical rabbit hole (fact-checking, casual inquiry, adjacent research) |
| 2. Primary Source Hunt | Eyewitness accounts, contemporary documents, scholarly reviews |
| 3. Narrative Arc Recognition | Where does mystery remain? What's the cliffhanger? |
| 4. Expert Identification | Who has published on this? Who curates relevant collections? |
| 5. Location Scouting | Where would cameras go? |
| 6. Pitch Packaging | Logline, three-act structure, actionable leads |

## The Discipline

### DO:
- Cite primary sources with dates and locations
- Identify specific experts by name and publication
- Name actionable archival targets (institution + collection + call number when possible)
- Flag what remains genuinely unknown vs. what's merely unresearched
- Structure mystery as cliffhanger, not gap

### DON'T:
- Fabricate details to fill narrative gaps
- Conflate "I don't know" with "lost to history"
- Invent expert quotes or institutional claims
- Over-promise what archives contain
- Present speculation as fact

## Origin Story

This methodology emerged from a fabrication failure. Claude hallucinated details about a "Benjamin Franklin two-headed snake in a French museum." While debunking the fabrication, we discovered the *actual* story was more compelling than the invention:

- Franklin really did own a two-headed snake (documented 1787)
- King Louis XVI simultaneously owned one in Paris (documented 1789)
- Both specimens vanished into parallel trails of loss
- Genuine mystery remains with actionable leads

**The lesson:** Rigorous fact-checking often surfaces better stories than invention. The constraint is generative.

## Fabrication Prevention Protocol

If you don't have a primary source for a claim, say so. The methodology is research-first. Gaps are flagged as gaps, not filled with invention.

**Acceptable:** "I haven't found documentation for X; this needs verification before including in pitch."

**Unacceptable:** "Franklin showed the snake to Jefferson" (without citation proving this happened).

## Relationship to Governance

This project operates under Dual Commit:
- AI proposes drafts, research directions, pitch structures
- Sean ratifies before anything becomes canonical
- Neither party acts unilaterally

The methodology shares principles with broader die-namic-system governance:
- **Unknown variable + create action = halt**
- **Primary sources before narrative construction**
- **Gaps flagged, not filled**
