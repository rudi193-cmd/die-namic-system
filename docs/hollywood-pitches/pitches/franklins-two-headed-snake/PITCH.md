## Logline

Two founding figures of the modern age—Benjamin Franklin and King Louis XVI—both possessed two-headed snakes at the exact same moment in history. Both died within four years. Both specimens vanished. One trail ends in fire, the other in revolutionary chaos. But nine of sixteen catalogued bicephalic snakes in Paris have never been physically located.

**Word count:** 50

## Tone

Cabinet of curiosities meets historical detective story. Part *American Pickers* archival hunt, part *Secrets of the Dead* investigation.

## Three-Act Structure

### Act I: The Curiosity
- Franklin receives two-headed snake during Constitutional Convention (July 1787)
- The political metaphor he almost made (unity/division) before being reminded of secrecy rules
- Parallel: Louis XVI's specimen documented same years in Paris
- Two men, two snakes, two revolutions, both dead by 1793

### Act II: The Trail
- Follow Franklin's snake: estate → Peale's Museum → Barnum/Kimball → fire
- Follow Louis's snake: Cabinet du Roi → Revolution → MNHN → ?
- The asymmetry: American trail ends definitively in flames; French trail goes cold in bureaucracy
- Introduce Van Wallach, the scholar who catalogued every known bicephalic snake

### Act III: The Hunt
- MNHN has 9 unlocated bicephalic snakes from historical catalogues
- 85% of collection (68 million specimens) remains undigitized
- Physical search of teratological storage
- Even if Louis XVI's snake is lost, the hunt surfaces other specimens
- Cliffhanger: what else is in that basement?

## What Makes This Pitch Work

1. **Dual narrative:** Two snakes, two founders, two revolutions — parallel structure is inherently cinematic
2. **Genuine mystery:** We know the American snake burned; we don't know about the French one
3. **Actionable hunt:** Production can actually go look in MNHN basement
4. **Expert access:** Van Wallach is alive and has published extensively
5. **Visual locations:** Independence Hall, Paris natural history museum, Harvard — production-friendly
6. **Built-in cliffhanger:** 9 unlocated specimens means the story has a real ending to discover
