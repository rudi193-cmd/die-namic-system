## The American Trail

### The Acquisition (July 1787)

Manasseh Cutler's journal entry for July 13, 1787 provides the eyewitness account:

Franklin received a two-headed snake during the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. He showed it to delegates and began drawing a political analogy about unity and division before being reminded of the Convention's secrecy rules.

**Key details from Cutler:**
- The snake was alive
- Preserved in a large glass jar
- Franklin used it as a conversation piece with visitors

**Source:** Manasseh Cutler journal, July 13, 1787 (Ohio History Connection / Published)

### The Dispersal (1790-1849)

Franklin died April 17, 1790.

**Estate inventory:** Does not specifically list the two-headed snake. This is a gap — we don't have definitive documentation of where the specimen went immediately after his death.

**Likely destination:** Peale's Museum in Philadelphia

**Supporting provenance:**
- The American Philosophical Society received Franklin's books and papers, not specimens
- Charles Willson Peale's museum was the natural repository for natural history curiosities in Philadelphia
- Documented precedent: A mastodon tooth transferred from Franklin to Peale (this establishes the relationship)

**Research gap:** No document has been located that explicitly tracks the snake from Franklin's estate to Peale. This connection is inferred from circumstantial evidence and period practices.

### The Loss (1848-1865)

Peale's Museum collection was sold in 1848-49 and split between two buyers:
- P.T. Barnum (New York) — American Museum
- Moses Kimball (Boston) — Boston Museum

**The fires:**
- Kimball's Boston Museum fire: 1851
- Barnum's American Museum fire: July 13, 1865

**Survival rate:** Only 4 bird specimens from the entire Peale collection survived to reach Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology.

**Conclusion:** Franklin's two-headed snake was almost certainly destroyed in one of these fires. The American trail ends definitively.

## The French Trail

### The Parallel Specimen (1789)

Bernard Germain de Lacépède documented a dicephalic *Bothrops lanceolatus* belonging to Louis XVI in his "Histoire naturelle des serpents" (1789).

**Key details:**
- Specimen housed in the Cabinet du Roi (royal natural history collection)
- Documented the same year the French Revolution began
- Louis XVI was executed January 21, 1793

**Source:** Lacépède, "Histoire naturelle des serpents" (1789) — digitized on Gallica/BnF

### Revolutionary Transition (1793)

The Cabinet du Roi became the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle (MNHN) in 1793 during the Revolution.

**Implication:** Louis XVI's specimen, if it survived the revolutionary chaos, would have been absorbed into MNHN's collections.

### The Undigitized Archive (Present)

MNHN presents a genuine research opportunity:

| Fact | Source |
|------|--------|
| 16 bicephalic snake specimens catalogued historically | MNHN records |
| 7 have been physically located | MNHN records |
| 9 remain uncatalogued in storage or misfiled | Inference from above |
| 85% of 68 million specimens undigitized | MNHN institutional statements |
| Handwritten catalogues date to 1864 | MNHN archives |

**Research gap:** No one has conducted a systematic physical search of MNHN's teratological collection specifically looking for Louis XVI's specimen or the 9 unlocated bicephalic snakes.

**Actionable opportunity:** A production team with institutional access could actually conduct this search. The story has a real ending to discover.

## The Scholarly Framework

Van Wallach's 2007 article in the Bulletin of the Maryland Herpetological Society provides the comprehensive scholarly review of bicephalic snakes.

**What Wallach catalogued:**
- Every known bicephalic snake specimen in institutional collections
- Historical documentation of specimens now lost
- Classification and anatomical analysis

**Research task:** Verify whether Wallach specifically addressed the Franklin and Louis XVI specimens, and what his conclusions were about their fates.

## Research Gaps (Flagged)

| Gap | Status | Action Needed |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| Franklin estate → Peale transfer documentation | Unverified | Search APS archives, Independence NHP Peale records |
| Louis XVI specimen post-Revolution fate | Unknown | MNHN teratological collection physical search |
| Wallach's specific treatment of these specimens | Unverified | Obtain and review 2007 article |
| MNHN 1864 catalogue entries for bicephalic snakes | Unverified | Physical archive research at MNHN |

## What We Know vs. What We're Inferring

### Documented Facts
- Franklin owned a two-headed snake (Cutler 1787)
- Louis XVI owned a dicephalic *Bothrops lanceolatus* (Lacépède 1789)
- Peale collection split Barnum/Kimball (documented sales)
- Both Barnum and Kimball museums burned (documented fires)
- MNHN has 16 catalogued bicephalic specimens, 9 unlocated (institutional records)

### Reasonable Inferences
- Franklin's snake went to Peale (no direct documentation, but consistent with period practice)
- Franklin's snake destroyed in fire (no survival evidence; low survival rate from Peale collection)
- Louis XVI's snake absorbed into MNHN (institutional continuity from Cabinet du Roi)

### Genuine Unknowns
- Whether Louis XVI's specific specimen survives in MNHN storage
- Which of the 9 unlocated MNHN bicephalic snakes might be historically significant
- What a physical search of MNHN's teratological collection would surface
