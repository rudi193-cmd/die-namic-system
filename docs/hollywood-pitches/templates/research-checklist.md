# Research Checklist

Use this checklist before marking a pitch "Ready." Each item must be verified or explicitly flagged as a gap.

---

## Primary Source Verification

- [ ] **Core claim documented:** The central historical fact has at least one primary source citation
- [ ] **Date verified:** All dates cited have been cross-referenced
- [ ] **Location verified:** All locations cited are accurate and visitable
- [ ] **No fabricated details:** Every specific claim traces to a source (not inference or invention)

---

## Source Quality Assessment

- [ ] **Primary sources identified:** Eyewitness accounts, contemporary documents, or official records
- [ ] **Secondary sources identified:** Scholarly articles, academic books, peer-reviewed research
- [ ] **Access paths documented:** Each source has a clear access route (archive, library, digital)
- [ ] **Digitized sources linked:** URLs provided for any freely accessible materials

---

## Expert Identification

- [ ] **At least one expert identified:** Name, affiliation, and relevant publication
- [ ] **Publication verified:** The cited work exists and is accessible
- [ ] **Current status confirmed:** Expert is alive, reachable, and in a position to participate
- [ ] **Institutional contacts identified:** Position-based leads for archives/museums

---

## Location Scouting

- [ ] **At least three locations identified:** Specific sites where cameras would go
- [ ] **Visual value assessed:** Each location offers something filmable
- [ ] **Access feasibility noted:** Public site, requires permission, or restricted

---

## Gap Documentation

- [ ] **Research gaps flagged:** What remains unknown is explicitly stated
- [ ] **Gaps vs. unknowns distinguished:** "I haven't found this" ≠ "This doesn't exist"
- [ ] **No speculation presented as fact:** Inferences are labeled as inferences
- [ ] **Actionable next steps identified:** What research would close each gap

---

## Narrative Integrity

- [ ] **Mystery is genuine:** The cliffhanger isn't manufactured; there's a real question
- [ ] **Three-act structure holds:** The story works as a narrative, not just a list of facts
- [ ] **Ending is discoverable:** Production could actually find/film something new

---

## Final Review

- [ ] **Logline ≤50 words:** Tight, compelling, accurate
- [ ] **Format specified:** Documentary, docuseries, narrative — with reasoning
- [ ] **All files complete:** PITCH.md, RESEARCH.md, SOURCES.md, EXPERT_LEADS.md
- [ ] **Checksum applied:** ΔΣ=42
