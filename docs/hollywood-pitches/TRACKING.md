# Hollywood Pitches — 23³ Tracking Structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Version | 1.0 |
| Last Updated | 2026-01-04 |
| Framework | Three-Layer Model (Anonymous → Pseudonymous → Named) |

---

## Layer Definitions (Adapted for Pitches)

| Layer | Relationship Meaning | Pitch Meaning | Criteria |
|-------|---------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Anonymous** | Aggregate pattern, no individual | Concept — topic area identified | No primary sources yet; narrative potential recognized |
| **Pseudonymous** | Identifiable handle, unconfirmed | In Development — research underway | Sources gathering but not all verified; experts by position not name |
| **Named** | Confirmed identity, biographical weight | Ready — production-ready package | All sources verified; experts named with publications; Sean ratified |

---

## Promotion Logic

### Anonymous → Pseudonymous
- **Trigger:** Primary source identified
- **Criteria:** At least one verifiable document, witness, or expert exists
- **Action:** Create pitch folder, begin RESEARCH.md

### Pseudonymous → Named
- **Trigger:** All checklist items complete
- **Criteria:** Sources verified, experts named, three-act structure holds
- **Action:** Dual Commit required (Claude proposes, Sean ratifies)

---

## LAYER 3: NAMED (Ready)

*Production-ready packages with verified sources and named experts.*

| Pitch | Format | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| (none yet) | — | — | Franklin awaits ratification |

---

## LAYER 2: PSEUDONYMOUS (In Development)

*Active research, sources gathering, experts identified by position.*

| Pitch | Source Material | Primary Sources | Expert Leads | Promotion Blocker |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Franklin's Two-Headed Snake** | Handoff origin story | Cutler 1787, Lacépède 1789 | Van Wallach (named), MNHN curator (position) | Sean ratification |
| **The Mighty Cat Brain Named Me Sweet Pea** | Essay (docs/creative_works/essays/) | Living Pharaohs members, club records since 1993 | Bob Gibson (named, deceased), current chapter members | Pitch reframing needed |
| **Mann Family Patterns** | MANN_FAMILY_PATTERNS.md, Books of Life | Grace's photo albums, genealogical records, living family | Family members (named) | Privacy review, pitch reframing |
| **The Gate** | docs/dci/, PITCH_PACKAGE | DCI archives, scoring histories | Corps directors, caption judges (positions) | Format question: documentary about the pitch itself? |

---

## LAYER 1: ANONYMOUS (Concept)

*Topic areas with documentary potential — no primary source research yet.*

| Concept | Source Signal | Documentary Angle | Promotion Trigger |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Gerald Phenomenon** | r/DispatchesFromReality engagement | Meta-documentary: building absurdist fiction community with AI | Identify primary sources (Reddit analytics, community members) |
| **Books of Mann Process** | Quadrilogy in development | Meta-documentary: writing sci-fi with AI collaboration | Identify what makes this filmable |
| **Books of Life Methodology** | Books of Life architecture | Documentary: "Speaker for the Dead" approach to biography | Identify comparable practitioners, ethical framework |
| **SAFE Protocol Development** | safe-protocol repo, journal app concept | Documentary: building privacy-first social tech | Crosses into product-pitch territory — placement TBD |

---

## SEPARATE DOMAIN: Product Pitches

*Not Hollywood pitches — game/product IP licensing.*

| Project | Current Location | Target Location | Status |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| **TTG (Teen Titans Go TTRPG)** | Google Drive, origin_materials/ | docs/product-pitches/ttg/ | Migration pending |
| **Gravity Falls TTRPG** | Google Drive (TTG pitch folder) | docs/product-pitches/gravity-falls/ | Migration pending |
| **Gateway Engine** | Google Drive (TTG pitch folder) | docs/product-pitches/gateway-engine/ | Migration pending |
| **SAFE Protocol** | safe-protocol repo (Claude Code) | TBD — product or Hollywood? | Placement decision needed |

## Cross-Reference: Promotion Candidates

### Ready for Pseudonymous → Named
| Pitch | Blocker | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Franklin's Two-Headed Snake | Sean ratification | Review PITCH.md, RESEARCH.md, SOURCES.md, EXPERT_LEADS.md |

### Ready for Anonymous → Pseudonymous
| Concept | First Primary Source | Action |
|---------|---------------------|--------|
| The Mighty Cat Brain | Essay exists, Bob Gibson documented | Create pitch folder, reframe essay as research |
| Mann Family Patterns | MANN_FAMILY_PATTERNS.md exists | Privacy review first, then pitch folder |
