## Purpose

This project develops historically-grounded story pitches suitable for documentary, docuseries, or narrative film adaptation. Each pitch follows a research-first methodology where compelling narratives emerge from primary source investigation rather than fiction-forward development.

**Core Value Proposition:** Pre-packaged research that production teams would normally spend months assembling — primary sources identified, expert leads compiled, narrative arcs structured, actionable filming locations specified.

**What We Deliver:** A pitch package that lets a production team move directly to outreach and scheduling, bypassing the 3-6 month research phase most projects require.

## Authority

Sean Campbell. No exceptions.

This project operates under Dual Commit governance:
- AI proposes drafts, research directions, pitch structures
- Sean ratifies before anything becomes canonical
- Neither party acts unilaterally

## Quality Standard

A pitch is "ready" when:

- [ ] Logline is ≤50 words
- [ ] Three-act structure is complete
- [ ] All factual claims have primary source citations
- [ ] At least one expert lead is identified with publication
- [ ] At least three filming locations are specified
- [ ] Mystery/cliffhanger is genuine (not manufactured)
- [ ] Format recommendation is specific
- [ ] Research gaps are explicitly flagged (not hidden)

## Origin Story

This methodology emerged from a fabrication failure. Claude hallucinated details about a "Benjamin Franklin two-headed snake in a French museum." While debunking the fabrication, we discovered the *actual* story was more compelling than the invention. The lesson: rigorous fact-checking often surfaces better stories than invention. The constraint is generative.

See [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md) for full details.
