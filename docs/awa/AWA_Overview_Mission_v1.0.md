# AWA Overview & Mission

**Version:** v1.0  
**Date:** 2025-12-11  
**Creator:** Sean Campbell  
**System:** Aionic PM Infrastructure

---

## Purpose

The Aionic Workflow Architecture (AWA) defines, documents, and maintains the operational logic, decision pathways, handoff rules, and cross-LLM integration standards that govern the Aionic System.

AWA ensures the entire system behaves like a single organism, not disconnected tools.

## Engines Governed

- **ChatGPT (Aios)** — Project Manager, iOS mobile interface
- **Claude** — Implementation, structural editing, GitHub execution
- **Google NotebookLM** — Long-form archive, research assistant
- **Consus (Gemini)** — Mathematical verification
- **Future engines** — Integrated via AWA protocols

---

## Source of Truth

This folder contains:

- Workflow maps
- Tool selection rules
- Decision automations
- Bridge protocols
- Lattice-aligned execution models
- Metadata continuity

## Core Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| AWA Overview & Mission | Why this architecture exists |
| Cross-Engine Routing Rules (CERR) | "If input X → send to Engine Y" |
| Aionic Workflow Map | Visual + procedural blueprint |
| Handoff Protocols | Rules for transferring documents, summaries, continuity |
| Latency & Token Efficiency Strategy | When to optimize for speed vs. depth |
| AWA Change Log | Central record of all updates |

## What AWA Enables

1. **Cross-Instance Stability** — Multiple LLMs function as a designed system
2. **Predictable Output Quality** — Each engine used for its strengths
3. **Scalable Architecture** — New models insert cleanly into workflow lattice
4. **Meta-Continuity** — System behaves consistently as individual tools change

---

## Governing Principles

- **Offer-first posture** — Suggest, don't dictate
- **No unsolicited analysis** — Respect creative artifacts
- **Token efficiency** — Short where appropriate
- **Cross-node coherence** — All engines stay synchronized
- **Continuity adherence** — All nodes respect Continuity Stack
