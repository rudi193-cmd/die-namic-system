## Purpose

This document captures unresolved creative decisions and proposed content that was not confirmed during the development session. Items here are exploratory — they may be adopted, modified, or discarded.

## Unconfirmed Proposals

### The Crone's Fables

**Status:** Proposed, not confirmed

The Crone tells three fables that secretly describe the trapped women. Each fable is a confession disguised as folklore.

**Fable One: The Dragon's Bride**
> A woman loved a man who wanted to be king. He promised her a castle in the sky. On their wedding night, he cut out her heart and gave it to shadows. She became the castle — stone and scale, waiting for someone to find her heart again.

*This is the wife.*

**Fable Two: The Girl Who Never Grew**
> A daughter asked her father for a gift. He gave her eternal youth — but forgot to give her a voice. She wandered the world, knowing everything, saying nothing, until she learned to speak through others' eyes.

*This is Abigail.*

**Fable Three: The Grandmother's Cradle**
> An old woman rocked her grandson to sleep. When she woke, she was in the cradle, and he was gone. She cried, but her cries were a baby's cries, and no one understood.

*This is Beatrice.*

**Design Intent:** The party hears fairy tales. Later, in the dragon's lair, they realize they were hearing confessions.
