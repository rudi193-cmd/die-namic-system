## Overview

**System:** D&D 5e (adapted for younger audiences)  
**Tone:** Family-friendly with themes of compassion, second chances, and moral complexity  
**Structure:** Two-campaign arc (Valley of Vander → The Drakonite)  
**Levels:** 1 (Valley of Vander), 2+ (The Drakonite)

---

## The Secret History

Generations ago, the First Vander made a pact with dark elves. In exchange for power and riches, he sold the souls of his wife, daughter, and mother. The elves twisted their punishment:

- **The wife** became a dragon, entombed beneath Dragon's Tooth Peak
- **The daughter** was frozen as a child (Abigail)
- **The mother** was trapped as an infant (Beatrice)

All three remained fully aware, unable to speak their truth. The dark elves didn't just take payment — over centuries, they *became* the blight now spreading across the land.

**The central tragedy:** Villippe has been trying to protect his family without understanding that his mother is a child and his great-great-grandmother is a baby.

## The Three-Path System

Players choose early; their path shapes every encounter:

| Path | Philosophy | Approach |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Vander** | Compassion | Healing, purity, working with nature |
| **Drakonite** | Order | Control, harnessing power |
| **Independent** | Self-reliance | Forging a third way |

Path choice affects:
- Encounter resolutions (combat vs. puzzle vs. negotiation)
- NPC reactions
- Side quest availability
- Stone fragment acquisition
- Final dungeon approach

## Campaign One: The Valley of Vander (Level 1)

### The Hook

A magical compulsion draws the party to Vanderhaven. Abigail asks them to retrieve fresh clothes from her house. An old woman shoves four ancient tomes and a silver compass into their arms with cryptic warnings about the Vander family.

### The Journey (3 Days)

**Day 1: Plains of Eldoria**
- Kobold ambush (fight, negotiate, or flee)
- Giant Centipede encounter
- Wanderer's Cache discovery (gold, potions, Stones of the Wanderer, silver locket with map)
- Camp at Lake Eldoria — supplies mysteriously replenish

**Day 2: Whispering Woods**
- Badger encounter
- Stirge colony
- Hobgoblin patrol — fight or deal (Specter if deal taken)

**Day 3: Black Mountains Cavern**
- Mountain Door Puzzle (riddle + four stone dials)
- River Gremlin at rickety bridge
- The Crossroads (three paths):
  - Deep Path: Ogre, Giant Cave Snake
  - Explorer's Trail: Shrieker Mushrooms, Cave Bear Cub
  - Path of Whispering Light: Luminaquas water spirit

### The Red Button Sequence

- Party finds Medallion of Whispers (read any written language)
- Giant red button under energy shield
- Glyph decipherment disables shield
- Button releases frogs, then a blinded Slaad
- Marble statues may release Malevolent Spirits

### Climax

- **King's Echo** — skeleton king on throne, corrupted guardian (puzzle or combat)
- **Treasure Room** — Prince Villippe chained, guarded by Kin Spirit
- Party uses tome knowledge to calm Kin Spirit

### Resolution

- Villippe freed, gives ornate silver key
- Return as heroes
- Vanderhaven becomes New Vanderhaven
- Rewards: Crown of Unity, Scroll of Vander, Stone of the First Vander
- Compass points toward "new kingdom"

**Hidden truth:** Abigail has been guiding them from the start. She is Villippe's mother.

## Campaign Two: The Drakonite (Levels 2+)

### The Core Conflict

Two noble houses fight for the throne as tremors shake the land:

**House Vander**
- Current rulers
- Power from ancient "pact with the earth" (actually the dark bargain)
- Prince Villippe: fearful, secretive, genuinely protective
- Abigail: appears to be his daughter, actually his mother

**House Drakonite**
- Led by Kaelan Blackheart
- Pragmatist who sees Vander magic as weakness
- Discovered dark crystals beneath the mountain
- Not villains — convinced order beats fading nobility

### Act Structure

**Act 1: Vanderhaven**
- Abigail's prophetic vision
- Kaelan arrives with Writ of Succession
- "Two Kings" scene (tiered Insight checks reveal different truths)
- Party chooses path

**Act 2: The Road**
- The Crone tells three fables (foreshadowing the trapped women)
- Cottage appears on passed checks
- Rewards: Pure Magic Dew, Locket of Warning
- Stone of First Vander can summon King's Echo

**Act 3: The Whispering Woods**
- Blocked path forces choice: brute force or Blighted Standing Stone puzzle
- Needle Blight encounter (peaceful for Vander/Independent, combat for Drakonite)
- Puzzling Stream and Water Wyrm
- Sunken Cavern and Heart of the Lake (corrupted nexus)
- Path-specific side quests → stone fragments

**Act 4: The Descent**
- Weeping Creek shows spreading corruption
- Tunneler Beetles ambush (path-dependent resolution)

**Act 5: Eldergate**
- Dying elven city of tarnished industry
- Shops: Iron & Ember, Ma Hildi's Kitchen, Silas's Finest Garb, Zorp's Wonders
- The Smoldering Ingot pub (mini-games, NPC contacts)
- Garon's riddle yields Key Map Fragment

**Act 6: Chaos of Eldergate**
- Both armies converge
- Echo Shades and Blight Wyrd block escape
- Three path-specific escape routes

**Act 7: The Iron Strait**
- Bay impassable by boat (kraken destroys small vessels)
- Giant turtle ferry, injured by blight, refuses to move
- Alexi Ofshield: guild leader fused to chair, two wooden legs, trusts no one
- **Vander:** Heal turtle with Pure Magic Dew
- **Independent:** Negotiate, Alexi teaches healing
- **Drakonite:** Force the wounded turtle across
- Kraken surfaces during crossing — watches, doesn't attack unless provoked
- Arrive at dusk, long rest on turtle shell

**Act 8: Dragon's Tooth Peak**
- Dawn, abandoned mining camp
- Blighted undead miners attack
- Main approach blocked by rockfall — mine is only way in
- 3 levels, 5 rooms each
- Side quest on level 2
- Bodies of failed predecessors (walked other paths, couldn't finish alone)
- Party collects remaining stone fragments

### The Dragon's Lair

At bottom: the dragon.  
Behind the dragon, looking like captives: Abigail holding Beatrice.

**The misdirect:** Classic rescue setup. But it's not a prison — it's a reunion. Abigail brought them all here.

### The Truth Revealed

- The dragon is the First Vander's wife — prisoner, not monster
- Abigail is the daughter, frozen in child form
- Beatrice is the mother, trapped as infant
- All three fully aware, unable to speak it
- Abigail's farsight guided the party here
- This isn't rescue — it's an appointment three generations in the making

### The Release

Three stone fragments, each freeing one soul:
- **Seed of Life** → frees the wife (dragon)
- **Stone of Order** → frees Beatrice (restores time)
- **Stone of Balance** → frees Abigail (restores identity)

Combined in the Locket of Warning, they form a complete stone generating a 30-foot cone shield.

### Collapse

Souls freed → blighted silver veins shatter → Dragon's Tooth Peak collapses.

**10 minutes to escape.**

Party races up through crumbling mine, locket shield protecting from falling stone. They emerge in Silverstream — thriving town on southern coast, under Drakonite rule.

The mirror image. The blight is broken. The souls are free. The mountain is gone. The party surfaces in "enemy" territory, faced with proof the world is more complicated than they thought.
