## Map Decisions

The following decisions were made to reconcile campaign documents with an existing map sketch:

1. **Castle Drakon moved off-map** — Drakonite territory is far to the east (~18 days), not visible on the regional map. The Drakonites are a foreign threat marching in, not neighbors squabbling over a fence.

2. **Central castle removed** — A moated castle previously labeled "Castle Drakon" in the map center no longer exists in canon.

3. **Journey preserved as epic** — Travel times remain long; tension comes from distance and the march of time.

## Key Locations

### Vanderhaven / New Vanderhaven

**Position:** Valley northeast of the Whispering Woods  
**Type:** Starting settlement  
**Governance:** House Vander  
**Campaign Role:** Origin point for both campaigns

After Valley of Vander, the town is renamed "New Vanderhaven" in celebration.

---

### Whispering Woods

**Position:** Mountain-forest region north of Vanderhaven  
**Type:** Dangerous wilderness  
**Travel Time:** Part of the 3-day journey (Valley of Vander) and main route (The Drakonite)  
**Features:**
- Blighted Standing Stone
- Needle Blight territory
- Puzzling Stream
- Water Wyrm
- Sunken Cavern / Heart of the Lake
- Path-specific side quest locations

---

### Black Mountains Cavern

**Position:** Within the Whispering Woods region  
**Type:** Dungeon (Valley of Vander climax)  
**Features:**
- Mountain Door Puzzle
- River Gremlin bridge
- The Crossroads (three paths)
- Red Button sequence
- King's Echo throne room
- Treasure room (Villippe + Kin Spirit)

---

### Eldergate

**Position:** River delta on the northern bay  
**Type:** Elven harbor city  
**Status:** Dying — silver veins dried up, blight spreading  
**Governance:** Neutral (caught between the houses)  
**Features:**
- The Iron & Ember (smithy)
- Ma Hildi's Kitchen
- Silas's Finest Garb
- Zorp's Wonders
- The Smoldering Ingot (pub with mini-games)
- Garon (riddle-keeper)

---

### Iron Strait

**Position:** Body of water between Eldergate and Dragon's Tooth Peak  
**Type:** Water crossing  
**Hazard:** Kraken destroys small vessels  
**Transport:** Giant turtle ferry, operated by Alexi Ofshield  
**Condition:** Turtle injured by blight, refuses to move until healed/coerced

---

### Dragon's Tooth Peak

**Position:** Island in the bay, north of Eldergate  
**Type:** Final dungeon location  
**Origin:** Raised in ancient times by cooperation between elves and a dragon  
**Resource:** Silver veins (now corrupted, the blight itself)  
**Structure:**
- Abandoned mining camp (surface)
- Main approach blocked by rockfall
- Mine entrance (only way in)
  - 3 levels, 5 rooms each
  - Side quest on level 2
  - Bodies of failed predecessors
- Dragon's lair (bottom)

**Fate:** Collapses when souls are freed and blighted silver shatters.

---

### Silverstream

**Position:** Southern coast  
**Type:** Thriving town  
**Governance:** House Drakonite  
**Campaign Role:** Emergence point after escape from Dragon's Tooth Peak

The mirror image of Eldergate. While Eldergate dies under Vander influence, Silverstream thrives under Drakonite rule. The party surfaces in "enemy" territory, confronted with moral complexity.

---

### Castle Drakon / Drakonite City

**Position:** Far east, off the regional map (~18 days travel)  
**Type:** Seat of House Drakonite  
**Status:** Not detailed — represents the distant threat
