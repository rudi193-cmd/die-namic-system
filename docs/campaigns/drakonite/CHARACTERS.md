## The Trapped Souls

### The First Vander's Wife (The Dragon)

**True Form:** Human woman  
**Cursed Form:** Dragon, entombed beneath Dragon's Tooth Peak  
**Awareness:** Fully aware of her identity and imprisonment  
**Role:** The heart of the campaign's central mystery

The wife was traded to dark elves as payment for the First Vander's power and riches. She became a dragon — not a monster, but a prisoner. The island she helped raise became her tomb.

**Release:** Seed of Life

---

### Abigail

**Appears As:** Young girl with magical abilities  
**True Identity:** The First Vander's daughter, Villippe's mother  
**Cursed State:** Ages inverted, frozen in childlike form  
**Awareness:** Fully aware; has farsight ability  
**Campaign Role:** The secret architect of her own rescue

Abigail has been guiding the party from the very beginning. In Valley of Vander, she asks them to fetch her clothes — seemingly innocent, actually the first step in a multi-generational rescue mission. Her farsight lets her see the party coming; she brought herself and Beatrice to the mine for the final act.

**Key Moment:** Asking the party to fetch clothes in Valley of Vander takes on new meaning once her identity is revealed.

**Release:** Stone of Balance (restores identity)

---

### Beatrice

**Appears As:** Infant  
**True Identity:** The First Vander's mother, Villippe's great-great-grandmother  
**Cursed State:** Ages inverted, trapped as baby  
**Awareness:** Fully aware but cannot express it  
**Introduction:** Valley of Vander campaign

The cruelest inversion. The eldest became the youngest. She cries, but her cries are a baby's cries, and no one understands.

**Release:** Stone of Order (restores proper time)

---

## House Vander

### Prince Villippe

**Role:** Current ruler of House Vander  
**Disposition:** Fearful, secretive, genuinely protective  
**First Appears:** Chained in Valley of Vander, freed by party  
**Gift to Party:** Ornate silver key

Villippe has been trying to protect his family without understanding that his mother is a child and his great-great-grandmother is a baby. He knows something is wrong with the Vander legacy but not the full truth.

---

### The Old Woman

**Role:** Keeper of forbidden knowledge  
**First Appears:** Valley of Vander  
**Gifts:** Four ancient tomes, silver compass  
**Manner:** Cryptic warnings about the Vander family

---

### The Crone

**Role:** Oracle figure on the road  
**Appears When:** Players pass checks  
**Gifts:** Pure Magic Dew, Locket of Warning  
**Function:** Tells three fables that secretly describe the trapped women

Her cottage appears only to those who prove worthy. The fables she tells are confessions disguised as folklore.

---

## House Drakonite

### Kaelan Blackheart

**Role:** Leader of House Drakonite  
**Disposition:** Pragmatist, not villain  
**Motivation:** Believes Vander magic is a weakness; order and control are better  
**Discovery:** Dark crystals beneath the mountain — limitless power source  
**Entrance:** Arrives with the Writ of Succession, claiming the throne

Kaelan has legitimate grievances. He's not wrong that Vander magic is tainted — he just doesn't know why. Both kings are partially right.

---

## Spiritual Entities

### The King's Echo

**Nature:** Skeleton king on throne, corrupted guardian  
**Location:** Black Mountains Cavern (Valley of Vander)  
**Resolution:** Puzzle or combat  
**Summoning:** Stone of the First Vander can summon him on the road

Connection to main plot: Partially developed. Likely a remnant of the pact.

---

### The Kin Spirit

**Nature:** Ethereal force (blue light vs. black smoke)  
**Location:** Treasure room, guarding Prince Villippe  
**Cannot Be Defeated:** Must be calmed using knowledge from the tomes  
**Revelation:** Its pain comes from the Crowned Shade's manipulation

Connection to main plot: Partially developed. Opposing force to the corruption.

---

## Eldergate NPCs

### Garon

**Role:** Riddle-keeper  
**Location:** Eldergate  
**Function:** His riddle yields the Key Map Fragment

---

### Alexi Ofshield

**Role:** Guild leader, turtle ferry operator  
**Location:** Iron Strait  
**Physical State:** Fused to his chair, two wooden legs (kraken took the originals)  
**Disposition:** Trusts no one; the turtle is his baby  
**Path Interactions:**
- Vander: Earned trust through healing
- Independent: Teaches party to heal
- Drakonite: Beaten, forced compliance

---

## Failed Predecessors

**Location:** Dragon's Tooth Peak mine  
**Nature:** Bodies of adventurers who tried before  
**Significance:** Each walked a different path; none could finish alone  
**Function:** Source of the stone fragments the party didn't earn through their path

These almost-heroes add weight to the final dungeon. The party walks in with their item and walks out carrying the weight of those who failed.
