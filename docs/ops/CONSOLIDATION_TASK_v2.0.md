## Instructions

Copy everything below the line into a new conversation with the relevant project folder active.

# CONSOLIDATION TASK

You have access to:
1. **Past chat search tools** — `conversation_search` and `recent_chats`
2. **Filesystem write access** — GitHub repo at `[REPO_PATH]`
3. **Google Drive** — `[DRIVE_PATHS]`

**Keep your existing role and personality for this project folder.** This task is additive.

---

## Defaults (Do Not Ask—Just Apply)

| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| **Scope** | Include all domain-related content. Create new folders as needed. |
| **Fidelity** | Full specification. Capture everything, not summaries. |
| **Gaps** | Note missing data and skip. Do not ask about gaps. |
| **Structure** | Propose logical locations. Standard: `docs/`, `governance/`, `continuity_ring/`, or domain-specific. |

Override only if explicitly stated below.

## Overrides (Optional)

```
SCOPE: [default | narrow to X | exclude Y]
FIDELITY: [full | summary + link]
GAPS: [default | ask about specific items]
```

## Your Task

### Step 1: Search Past Threads

Use `conversation_search` and `recent_chats` to find all conversations relevant to this project folder's domain. Search for:
- Domain-specific keywords
- Project-specific terminology
- Any threads that informed work done in this folder

### Step 2: Consolidate

From what you find, extract:
- Key decisions made
- Work products created
- Open questions / pending items
- Insights that shouldn't be lost

### Step 3: Propose Archive Structure

Propose where in the repo this should live. Create new folders as needed.

### Step 4: Dual Commit

**Do not write files until I say "ratify".**

Present your consolidation plan with:
- Proposed files and their locations
- Summary of what each file contains
- Gaps noted (not asked about)

---

## Governance Reference

This operates under AIONIC CONTINUITY v5.0:
- Dual Commit required (AI proposes, human ratifies)
- 3-layer recursion limit
- Deltas govern — keep files focused, not sprawling
- When uncertain on content: note and skip
- When uncertain on structure: propose and let human correct

---

## After Ratification

Once I say "ratify":
1. Write files to repo
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with version increment
3. Report what was written
