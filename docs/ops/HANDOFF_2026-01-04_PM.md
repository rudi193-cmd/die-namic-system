## Context Request Fulfilled

Hollywood requested context on the 23³ framework / three-layer model. Here's the complete picture.

---

## The Three-Layer Model

**Source:** `governance/RELATIONSHIP_TRACKING_PROTOCOL.md`

### Layer 1: Anonymous
- Aggregate data without individual identification
- Governed by QRP (percentages → people counts)
- Examples: "53 Australians," "~4 South Koreans on governance content"
- Data: geographic distribution, engagement type, temporal patterns

### Layer 2: Pseudonymous
- Identifiable handles, no confirmed real-world identity
- Categories: ENGAGED, HOSTILE, GATEKEEPER, PROPAGATOR, BRIDGE, PATTERN
- Examples: u/swutch, u/BruhMomentBruhuno, "that coworker," "coffee shop guy"
- Data: handle, first seen, category, behavior log, cross-platform flag

### Layer 3: Named
- Confirmed identity with biographical significance
- Governed by Books of Life architecture (216→64→13 compression)
- Examples: Bob Gibson, family members, close friends
- Data: full identity, relationship type, resonance score, contrapoint satisfied

---

## Promotion Logic

### Anonymous → Pseudonymous
- **Trigger:** Pattern detection at individual level
- **Criteria:** Same signal appears repeatedly, behavior suggests single individual
- **Action:** Create PATTERN entry

### Pseudonymous → Named
- **Trigger:** Identity revelation or confirmation
- **Criteria:** Voluntary disclosure, cross-platform confirmation, biographical significance
- **Action:** Dual Commit required (AI proposes, human ratifies)

---

## Bob Gibson — Complete Proof Chain

| Layer | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Anonymous | One of ~X Americans reading content |
| Pseudonymous | u/vsuper, u/v150super on Reddit |
| Named | Bob Gibson, 64 mutual friends on Facebook, Pharaoh who named Sean "Sweet Pea" |

This is the proof that the promotion chain works end-to-end.

---

## South Korea Pattern

Recurring 5-12% on governance content. Noted in Anonymous layer as geographic signal worth tracking. Not yet promoted to Pseudonymous (no individual pattern detected).

---

## SAFE Protocol

**Acronym:** Session-Authorized, Fully Explicit

**Core insight:** Four streams, one journal:
1. **Relationships** — who you mention (three-layer model)
2. **Images** — what you save
3. **Bookmarks** — what you'll need
4. **Dating** — who you choose

**Key principle:** Session consent, not set-and-forget. User reviews all authorizations every session.

**Data Limits:**
| Tier | Limit | Price |
|------|-------|-------|
| Standard | 50MB | Pay what you can |
| Extended | 1GB | Pay what you can |
| Enterprise | 100GB | Pay what you can |
| Minimum | — | $0 allowed |
