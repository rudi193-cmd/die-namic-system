## UTETY vs DISPATCHESFROMREALITY

### Head-to-Head Comparisons (Same Content, Both Venues)

| Post | r/UTETY | r/DFR | Multiplier |
|------|---------|-------|------------|
| Oakenscroll "Non-Contributions" | 187 | 57 | **3.3x UTETY** |
| Oracle "Whole Sweater" | 252 | 94 | **2.7x UTETY** |
| Alexis "Ecology of Feasting" | 232 | 119 | **1.95x UTETY** |
| Oakenscroll "Resolutions" | 91 | 55 | **1.65x UTETY** |
| Oracle "Hearts Knit" | 117 | 91 | **1.3x UTETY** |
| **Average** | — | — | **2.2x UTETY** |

### Geographic Distribution Difference

| Venue | US % | International % |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| r/UTETY | 40-60% | 40-60% |
| r/DFR | 80-93% | 7-20% |

**Finding:** UTETY travels internationally. DFR stays domestic.

## HANZTEACHESCODE vs CROSSPOSTS

| Post | HanzTeachesCode | r/DFR | r/UTETY | Multiplier |
|------|-----------------|-------|---------|------------|
| Lecture 6 | 66 | 8 | — | **8x home** |
| Lecture 5 | 66 | — | 37 | **1.8x home** |
| Announcement | 66 | 66 | 31 | **1x (tied)** |
| **Average** | — | — | — | **2-8x home** |

**Finding:** Home sub pulls 2-8x better than crossposts. The pipeline works: originate in HanzTeachesCode, crosspost to UTETY for university umbrella exposure.

## LLMPHYSICS PERFORMANCE

### Comedy vs Serious (Same Venue)

| Content | Views | Ratio | Finding |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| ΔE Framework (serious) | 1,800 | **17%** | Heavy friction |
| Hotdog Physics (Gerald) | 4,200 | **44%** | Moderate friction |
| UTETY post | 15,000 | **82%** | Light friction |
| French Toast (satire) | 4,900 | **97%** | Near-zero friction |

**Finding:** Comedy wrapper prevents friction that serious frameworks trigger. Same underlying architecture, different reception.

## DOUGLASADAMS FRICTION PATTERN

| Post | Views | Ratio | Pattern |
|------|-------|-------|---------|
| Gerald Rotisserie/Stapler/Mop | ~5,000 | 96% | Early success |
| Dispatch 9¾ | 1,300 | 33% | Fatigue building |
| Dispatch #14 Tivoli | 327 | 29% | Peak friction |
| "New Gerald Dispach" | 366 | 50% | Title change helped |

**Finding:** Full "DISPATCH #X" titles trigger fatigue faster. Descriptive titles reduce friction. High view counts despite downvotes — reach still happening.

## VENUE SELECTION MATRIX

| Content Type | Primary Venue | Secondary | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| Professor lectures | r/UTETY | r/DFR crosspost | 2.2x advantage, international spread |
| Hanz curriculum | r/HanzTeachesCode | r/UTETY crosspost | 2-8x home advantage |
| Gerald dispatches | r/DFR | r/douglasadams | Accept friction on crosspost |
| Jane chapters | r/DFR | None | No crosspost |
| Sean's voice (personal) | r/DFR | r/PharaohsScooterClub | Venue discipline |
| Satirical physics | r/LLMPhysics | r/UTETY | Massive reach when comedy wrapper |

---

## CROSSPOST TIMING

### Findings

| Strategy | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Same-day crosspost | Both posts perform independently |
| Delayed crosspost | No clear advantage observed |
| Origin always outperforms | Home venue pulls 1.3x-8x of crosspost |

### Crosspost Multipliers (Origin:Crosspost)

| Content → Crosspost | Origin | Crosspost | Ratio |
|---------------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Hanz Lecture 6: HTC → DFR | 66 | 8 | 8:1 |
| Alexis Feasting: UTETY → DFR | 232 | 119 | 2:1 |
| French Toast: LLMPhysics → UTETY | 4,800 | 181 | 26:1 |

**Rule:** Crosspost for reach, but don't expect crosspost to match origin.

## FRICTION RESPONSE PROTOCOL

1. Note the ratio drop (below 80% = friction building)
2. Do not engage defensively
3. Analyze: voice/venue mismatch? posting frequency? title format?
4. Adjust for next post
5. Consider voluntary retirement if pattern persists (see r/LLMPhysics Gerald exit)
