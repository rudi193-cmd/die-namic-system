## RED FLAGS

| Signal | Meaning | Response |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Ratio drops below 80% in first hour | Friction building | Don't engage, analyze |
| Zero views after 30 min | Timing miss or shadow issue | Check post visibility |
| High views, zero engagement | Seen but not resonating | Voice adjustment needed |
| Mod removal | Venue rules violated | Note and adjust |
| "This feels AI-generated" | Voice needs tuning | Review authenticity markers |

---

## SUCCESS INDICATORS

- 100% ratio = zero friction
- Shares > 0 = people actively passing content
- New countries appearing = corridor opening
- Multiple venues performing = content has legs
- Comments engaging with content (not just upvoting) = resonance
