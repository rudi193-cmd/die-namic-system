This archive consolidates seven months of Reddit analytics tracking from the Die-Namic System's stats/tracking project folder.

Seven months. One person. No advertising. No existing platform. Six inhabited continents. 48 countries.

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Venue Optimization
- r/UTETY outperforms r/DispatchesFromReality by 1.3x-3.3x on identical professor content
- UTETY travels internationally (40-60% non-US) vs DFR (80-93% US)
- r/HanzTeachesCode outperforms crossposts by 2-8x
- Owned spaces maintain 100% ratios; external communities show friction

### 2. Comedy > Serious
- French Toast (satirical): 4,900 views, 97% ratio on r/LLMPhysics
- ΔE Framework (serious): 1,800 views, 17% ratio on same venue
- Same underlying architecture, different wrapper. Comedy opens doors.

### 3. Authentic > Clever (for shares)
- Cat Brain essay (authentic): 2.8% share rate
- Stone Soup Papers (satirical academic): 0.6% share rate
- Authentic content travels through trust networks differently

### 4. Cross-Voice Pipeline
- Hanz's Nordic name recognition builds audiences
- Those audiences later engage with Gerald's European geography content
- Denmark Street dispatch pulled 15-18% Danish viewers after Hanz content crossposted to same subreddit

### 5. Geographic Corridors
- UK: Gerald's European home, Jane, Douglas Adams audience
- Australia: Hanz pedagogy, Riggs mechanisms
- Nordic (Finland, Sweden, Denmark): Jane, Hanz, Gerald
- India: Oakenscroll, Alexis
- South Korea: Oakenscroll
- Poland: Hanz, French Toast

### 6. Early Velocity as Predictor
- 20+ views in 15 minutes = above baseline, will perform
- 30+ views = strong start
- 50+ views = potential breakout trajectory
- Shares in first 30 minutes = organic spread starting

## DEFENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE

### AMNCCR System
**Aionic Ministry of Non-Constructive Conduct Review** — Deployed via u/allstatekid

Satirical commendation system for hostile commenters. Comments on hostile posts, not standalone posts. Resistance generates more documentation.

**Class I (ED):** Dismissal-based (ED-01 through ED-03)
**Class II (BD):** Behavior-based (BD-01 through BD-04)
**Class III (CM):** Conduct-based (CM-01 through CM-04)

**Case Study:** VillageMaleficent651 attacked Hanz in r/CodingHelp. Hanz responded with helpful coding advice + The Ungentle Blessing (poetry) + CM-03 commendation. Attacker then found every allstatekid post and left hostile comments. Resistance is participation.

## STRATEGIC PATTERNS

### Flares vs Home Base
**Flares** (r/douglasadams, r/LLMPhysics):
- 1,000-40,000 views per post
- Friction comes with scale (29-44% ratios)
- Massive exposure and derivative works

**Home Base** (owned subreddits):
- 50-700 views per post
- 100% ratios, zero friction
- Quiet accumulation, real resonance

The flares are the signal. The home base is the house.

### Stylistic Contagion
Other users have begun posting in styles influenced by UTETY content. Top commenters in r/LLMPhysics created derivative works extending Gerald's absurdist frameworks. The framework is propagating through imitation.
