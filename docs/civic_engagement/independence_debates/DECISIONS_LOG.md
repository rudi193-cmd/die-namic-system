## Guiding Principles

1. **Protection without control** — Participants protected but not compensated
2. **Unedited authenticity** — 64 segments released raw, no moderation
3. **Ceremonial independence** — Not political programming
4. **Technical precision** — Frame-accurate, exact frequencies
5. **Multi-generational discovery** — ARG mysteries, inexhaustible depth

## Decision: Zero Compensation for Participation

**Choice:** 112 citizens receive $0 for participation

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates "paid actor" accusations
- Maintains authentic citizen status
- Prevents financial incentive from corrupting motives
- Participants exercise free speech, not perform for pay

**Trade-off:** 
- Post-broadcast income is 100% theirs (book deals, speaking fees, media appearances)
- Production covers travel/lodging during filming (not compensation)
- Protection services provided (not compensation)

**Signed Acknowledgment Required:**
> "I participated as a citizen exercising free speech, not as a paid performer. Any income I generate after July 5, 2026 from this participation is mine alone."

## Decision: 12-Month Protection Services for 112 Citizens

**Choice:** Comprehensive protection for 12 months post-broadcast

**Services Include:**
- Cybersecurity consultation and monitoring
- Dark web monitoring for personal information
- Identity theft protection
- Legal team on retainer (cease and desist, restraining orders, defamation)
- 24/7 security hotline for credible threats
- Relocation assistance up to $50,000 if necessary
- Employment protection (legal defense if terminated due to participation)
- Mental health support (52 sessions trauma counseling)
- Family coverage (spouse, minor children, dependents)

**Rationale:**
- Participants face real risk of harassment, doxxing, targeting
- Production has moral obligation to protect those it exposes
- 12 months covers peak exposure period
- Comprehensive coverage prevents participants from bearing costs of participation

---

## Decision: Zero Protection for 64 Humanitarian Segments

**Choice:** Humanitarian segment participants receive no protection services

**Rationale:**
- Different risk profile (brief appearance vs. intensive multi-week feature)
- 64 segments distributed across locations, no single person highly featured
- Keeps costs manageable
- Clear informed consent about different terms

**Full Informed Consent Required:**
- Understanding of zero protection
- Understanding that controversial statements will remain public
- Understanding of internet permanence

---

## Decision: Raw/Unedited Release of 64 Segments

**Choice:** Footage released exactly as captured, no editorial intervention

**Rationale:**
- Demonstrates commitment to democratic discourse
- Prevents accusations of selective editing
- Creates permanent, unalterable record
- Tests society's tolerance for diverse (including uncomfortable) views
- Counterpoint to produced, facilitated debate content

**Minimal Exceptions:**
- Safety blurring (non-consenting bystanders, minors)
- Technical failure exclusion (corrupted files)
- Legal compliance (court-ordered removal)

---

## Decision: Obama and Trump as Equal Co-Facilitators

**Choice:** Both presidents have absolutely equal status throughout

**Implementation:**
- Equal speaking opportunity (±5% variance)
- Equal production resources
- Equal promotional materials prominence
- Neither has editorial control
- Neither can approve final cut
- Both briefed on convergence sequence (cannot change it)

**Rationale:**
- Prevents either side claiming bias
- Creates genuine ceremonial neutrality
- Forces both to engage with citizens rather than each other
- Hot mic moment humanizes both without declaring winner

---

## Decision: American Idol Voting Model

**Choice:** Public voting narrows 112 → 64 → 13 → 2

**Rationale:**
- Engages audience actively
- Creates investment in participants
- Democratic selection mirrors democratic theme
- Proven engagement model (American Idol demonstrated)
- Cross-platform (text, social, web) maximizes participation

**Safeguards:**
- Fraud prevention protocols
- All votes weighted equally
- Results revealed during broadcasts for transparency

---

## Decision: Image-Based Citizen Selection

**Choice:** Citizens submit ONE IMAGE of what America means to them (not constitutional passages)

**Rationale:**
- Visual = more memetic/shareable
- Bypasses constitutional expertise barrier
- More personal/emotional entry point
- Creates gallery of "112 visions of America"
- Generates substantive discussion when presidents probe choices

---

## Decision: AI/RNG Selection of 7 Images in Week 2

**Choice:** Random selection of which images to discuss, live on stage

**Rationale:**
- No producer bias accusations
- Presidents can't prepare/strategize
- Ceremonial randomness (fate/democracy picking voices)
- Heightens spontaneity and authenticity
- Selection process visible on screen for transparency

---

## Decision: Stewart and Fallon Pre-Arranged (Not Surprise)

**Choice:** Stewart 11:48 and Fallon 11:56 arrivals are staged/planned, not genuine surprises

**Who Knows:**
- Obama knows
- Trump knows
- Winner knows general plan
- Timing is predetermined

**Who Doesn't Know:**
- Audience (appears spontaneous)
- Stewart doesn't know Fallon is coming (Fallon surprises Stewart)

**Rationale:**
- Logistics require coordination
- Security requires advance planning
- Spontaneity is for audience, not participants
- Authentic interaction still encouraged (no scripted dialogue)

---

## Decision: 72-Hour Silence Post-Broadcast

**Choice:** Production team maintains complete silence for 48-72 hours after broadcast

**Rationale:**
- Allows audience to process, discuss, theorize
- Prevents authoritative interpretation from shutting down conversation
- Essential for ARG investigation phase to launch
- Creates mystery that drives engagement

**72-Hour Statement:**
- Confirms intentionality of convergence and DIENAMIC ending
- Does NOT explain all Easter eggs
- Preserves substantial mystery
- Validates theories without resolving questions

---

## Decision: Simultaneous Triplecast

**Choice:** Identical content on MSNBC, Fox/Truth Media, and universal stream simultaneously

**Rationale:**
- Neither network can claim bias
- Both audiences see identical content
- Convergence must be simultaneous for all viewers (conceptually essential)
- Technical achievement mirrors democratic alignment theme

**Implementation:**
- Centralized playout servers
- Frame-accurate synchronization
- Extensive pre-broadcast testing
- Redundant systems

---

## Decision: Hard Cut to Black (No Credits)

**Choice:** Broadcast ends at 12:06:34 with immediate cut to black, no credits, no post-credits

**Rationale:**
- Denies conventional narrative closure
- Forces viewers to sit with what they experienced
- Maintains ceremonial framing through final moment
- No distancing effect of production apparatus becoming visible
- Convergence presented as event that occurred, not constructed entertainment

---

## Decision: The "03" Remains Unexplained

**Choice:** Green "03" on Bob's processed TV never explained in broadcast or official materials

**Rationale:**
- Drives post-broadcast speculation
- Trinity? Three branches? Third attempt? Third age?
- Mystery sustains engagement
- ARG communities will generate theories
- No definitive answer preserves inexhaustibility
