## The 7 Standard Questions

Every participant answers the same 7 questions:

1. **What does America mean to you?**
2. **What would you change about America?**
3. **What are you most proud of?**
4. **What are you most concerned about?**
5. **What do you want the next generation to know?**
6. **If you could say one thing to the president, what would it be?**
7. **What gives you hope?**

## Release Policy: Raw and Unedited

### What "Unedited" Means:
- Footage released exactly as captured
- No cuts, splices, rearrangements, or omissions
- No audio enhancement beyond standard noise reduction
- No color grading beyond technical broadcast standards
- No music, sound effects, graphics, or contextual framing
- No editorial commentary or producer interpretation

### What "Unedited" Does NOT Mean:
- Multiple camera angles combined (if multiple cameras used)
- Technical fixes for equipment malfunction
- Safety blurring (non-consenting bystanders, minors, personal info)
- Legal compliance edits (if court-ordered)

### Minimal Technical Exceptions:
1. Camera setup moments (not substantive) may be trimmed
2. Non-participant faces, minors in background may be blurred
3. Corrupted/inaudible recordings excluded (not reconstructed)
4. Illegal content removed with legal counsel approval

## Release Schedule

**Timing:** Released as production completes (no set order)

**Frequency:** Maximum 3-4 per day during weeks between broadcasts

**Platforms:**

**Duration:** Throughout four-week broadcast period

## Participant Terms

### Compensation: Zero
- No payment for participation
- Travel/lodging NOT covered (unless negotiated case-by-case)
- Participants understand this is uncompensated civic expression

### Protection Services: Zero
- Unlike the 112 debate citizens, humanitarian segment participants receive NO protection services
- No legal support
- No cybersecurity monitoring
- No harassment mitigation
- No relocation assistance

### Why This Distinction:
- 112 citizens are intensively featured across weeks
- 64 humanitarian segments are brief, distributed appearances
- Different risk profile
- Keeps costs manageable while acknowledging different exposure levels

### Full Informed Consent Required:
- Understanding of raw release policy
- Understanding of zero protection
- Understanding of internet permanence
- Understanding that controversial statements will remain public
- Right to withdraw before release (not after)

## Purpose

### Democratic Inclusion
- Voices beyond the 112 selected debaters
- Geographic diversity across iconic sites
- Socioeconomic diversity
- Age diversity
- Perspective diversity

### Counterpoint to Produced Content
- Raw testimony vs. facilitated discussion
- Unmediated vs. presidential-framed
- Individual vs. group dynamics

### Living Archive
- Evidence that convergence happened
- Americans from sacred sites witnessed it
- Cannot be edited or reframed
- Permanent record of 2026 American voices

### Test of Free Speech Commitment
- Some statements will be offensive to some viewers
- Some will be controversial
- Release demonstrates commitment to democratic discourse
- Society must process diverse (including uncomfortable) views
