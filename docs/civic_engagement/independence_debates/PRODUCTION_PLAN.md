## Distribution Strategy

### Dual-Anchor Broadcast
- **MSNBC**: Progressive audience anchor
- **Fox News / Truth Media**: Conservative audience anchor
- **Universal streaming**: Simultaneous release on major platforms

Dual-anchor prevents either side from claiming bias. Both audiences see identical content with their trusted network's framing.

### Archive Strategy
- Full 4-week archive on YouTube (free)
- Clips licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0
- Citizen stories released with consent

## Post-Broadcast ARG

### Immediate (First 24 hours)
- "Bob" social media accounts activate
- Factory coordinates hidden in broadcast metadata
- First clue: pocket Constitution ISBN leads to website

### Week 1-4 Post-Broadcast
- ARG participants discover DIENAMIC corporate history
- Bob's 40-year archive revealed piece by piece
- Other suppressed convergences shown
- Question deepens: "How many times has this happened?"

### Resolution
- ARG concludes with meta-question
- "Was the broadcast real, or was it the latest convergence to be archived?"
- No definitive answer — ambiguity is the point

## Production Partners (Ideal)

| Role | Target |
|------|--------|
| Executive Producer | Jon Favreau / Crooked Media |
| Network Partners | MSNBC + Fox/Truth |
| Streaming | Netflix / Amazon / Apple |
| ARG Design | Independent game studio |
| Bob Animation | Fallout-style artist |

---

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Candidate refusal | Frame as legacy opportunity, not campaign |
| Network conflict | Dual-anchor ensures neither controls narrative |
| Security concerns | Secret Service coordination from Week 1 |
| ARG confusion | Clear "fiction" markers post-reveal |
