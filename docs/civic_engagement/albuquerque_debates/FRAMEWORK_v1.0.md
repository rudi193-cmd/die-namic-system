## Core Concept

**Replace moderator questions with historical photographs.**

Instead of "what's your policy on housing?", show candidates a photograph of Albuquerque in 1918 and ask: "What would you have done differently? What does this tell us about today?"

The artifact forces genuine engagement. Candidates can't dodge a photograph the way they dodge a question.

## The Artifact

**Book:** *Early Albuquerque: A Photographic History, 1870-1918*
**Authors:** Byron A. Johnson and Robert K. Dauner
**Edition:** Albuquerque National Bank edition (1981)
**Content:** 300+ sepia images chronicling territorial-era Albuquerque

The book contains:
- Civic infrastructure decisions (jail, school, bank)
- Diverse crowd compositions
- City-building moments frozen in time
- Detailed captions providing historical context

**Key insight:** Every building in those photos was someone's policy decision. The debate asks candidates to engage with decisions made by past leaders.

## Structure

### Partner Organizations (7)

|---|--------------|------|
| 1 | Albuquerque Museum | Host venue, photo archive access |
| 2 | Albuquerque Historical Society | Historical context, curation |
| 3 | Indian Pueblo Cultural Center | Indigenous perspective |
| 4 | National Hispanic Cultural Center | Hispanic heritage lens |
| 5 | Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter | Environmental/land use |
| 6 | KOB TV | Broadcast partner |
| 7 | Albuquerque Teachers Federation | Education/future focus |

### Image Selection

| Source | Images |
|--------|--------|
| 7 organizations × 1 each | 7 |
| 2 candidates × 1 each | 2 |
| **Total** | **9** |

Each organization selects one photograph that represents their constituency's concerns. Candidates each select one photograph that represents their vision.

### Debate Format

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Images | 9 total |
| Rounds per image | 3 |
| Minutes per round | 5 |
| Total runtime | 135 minutes |

**Round structure:**
1. "What do you see in this photograph?"
2. "What decision was being made? Was it right?"
3. "How does this inform your approach today?"

## Venue

**Albuquerque Museum (Old Town)**

| Capacity | 50-500 people |
| Location | Historic Old Town district |
| Facilities | Indoor/outdoor spaces, catering, AV |
| Alignment | Houses city's photo archives |

Holding a debate about historical photos *in the museum that houses Albuquerque's history* creates thematic resonance.

---

## Audience

| Group | Size |
|-------|------|
| 7 organizations × 30 each | 210 |
| Media/overflow | 40-90 |
| **Total** | **250-300** |

Everyone in the audience receives a copy of *Early Albuquerque*.

---

## Key Insight

> "KOB has to *propose* the format first, and then the candidates just get a yes/no vote on it. They don't get to negotiate or shape it beforehand."

This is critical. If candidates co-design the debate, they'll veto anything interesting. The station proposes a complete package: "Here's the format, here's why we think it serves voters, are you in or out?"

---

## Why This Works

### For Voters
- See how candidates *think*, not just what they promise
- Historical grounding makes abstract policy concrete
- Shared artifact creates common reference point

### For Candidates
- Differentiation opportunity (can't give canned answers)
- Demonstrates depth of local knowledge
- Novel format generates media attention

### For KOB
- Distinctive programming in crowded election coverage
- Community partnership strengthens local ties
- Progressive positioning without partisan content

---

## The Delta

The core innovation: **Candidates interpret past leaders' decisions, not their own promises.**

This reveals:
- How they analyze historical context
- Whether they understand city-building as continuous process
- How they connect past decisions to present challenges

A candidate who sees only "old buildings" versus one who sees "infrastructure investments that shaped today's neighborhoods" — that contrast teaches voters something a policy debate never could.

## Political Context (2025)

| Factor | Relevance |
|--------|-----------|
| Nonpartisan race | Format works regardless of party |
| Runoff triggered | High stakes, audience engaged |
| KOB as progressive station | Willing to try unconventional formats |
| Political turmoil | Different thinking feels less risky |

---

## Alternative: Museum Partnership

Instead of sourcing physical books, partner directly with Albuquerque Museum's photo archives:
- Custom printed booklet for debate
- Access to unpublished images
- Institutional support and credibility
- Potentially lower cost than book acquisition
