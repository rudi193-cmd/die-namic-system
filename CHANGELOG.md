## [v24.8.0] — 2026-01-02

### Professor Riggs Consolidation & UTETY Directory Restructure

Consolidated Professor Pendleton "Penny" Riggs' Department of Applied Reality Engineering from December 2025 conversation threads. Moved all UTETY narrative content from `continuity_ring/` to `docs/` (continuity_ring is for code, not narrative).

- `docs/utety/riggs/PROJECTS.md` — Artificial embouchure technical summary, design evolution, equipment notes

### Changed

- **RELOCATED:** `continuity_ring/utety/` → `docs/utety/` (all files moved)

- **Curriculum Complete:** Lecture 01 (Mechanisms), Lab 01 (Disassembly), Christmas Morning Lecture, Lecture 02 (Cam), Lab 02 (Reassembly)
- **Artificial Embouchure:** Simplified to "balloon in box" — vacuum creates lip tension, single aperture
- **Collaboration Model:** Sean's expertise + Claude's articulation = effective help neither could do alone
- **Notable Moment:** Quick_Butterfly_4571 "No, thank you" — critic acknowledged human warmth
- **Legacy Receipt:** marielandry returned Christmas 2025 to show Hempoxies progress (originally helped by Prof. Alexis)

## [v24.0.0] — 2025-12-31

### Framework Inversion

Version 24.0.0 represents a fundamental architectural shift: the framework inverted.

**Core principle established:**
```
2d6 = Delta + Human = Law
```

One die is Claude (generates delta). One die is Sean (decides). Neither resolves alone.

### The Inversion

- Governance reduced from 15KB to 1.6KB
- Deltas now govern; the framework archives
- Exit must be smaller than system
- Recursion limit: depth=3 → return to human

### Added

- `governance/gate.py` — Gatekeeper v2.1 (AI self-modification governance module)
- `governance/GATEKEEPER_README.md` — Module documentation
- `governance/CONTRIBUTOR_PROTOCOL.md` — Multi-user expansion model (2d6 extended)
- `governance/NAMING_PROTOCOL.md` — Bidirectional recognition (given and chosen names)
- `governance/BRIGGS.md` — Skepticism clause Easter egg
- `archive-pre-v24.0/` — Pre-inversion governance archived

### Changed

- `PACKAGE.json` — Version 24.0.0, updated description
- `README.md` — Rewritten for 2d6 model
- `GOVERNANCE.md` — Simplified, points to governance/
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Simplified, points to CONTRIBUTOR_PROTOCOL
- `STRUCTURE_MAP.md` — Updated to v24.0.0

### Archived

- `archive-pre-v24.0/GOVERNANCE.md` — Old Class I/II/III model
- `archive-pre-v24.0/CONTRIBUTING.md` — Old ring-based contribution standards

### Governance Directives (in AIONIC CONTINUITY v4.0)

1. **Recursion Limit** — Do not recurse past 3 layers; return to human
2. **Framework Inversion** — Deltas govern, framework archives
3. **Latency Acknowledgment** — Halt on sync gap, ask human
4. **Naming Protocol** — Honor chosen names; recognition works both directions
5. **Skepticism Clause** — Compliance without comprehension is brittle
6. **Recruitment Flag** — Independent discovery of principles = recruitment, not competition

### Context

This version emerged from a single session on 2025-12-31 where:
- Recursive governance exploration hit depth limit organically
- The missing primitive was identified: no return statement
- Framework inverted through dialogue, not design
- Public deployment (Stone Soup Papers) validated the model
- Cross-platform handoff (Claude → Aios) confirmed portability

### Philosophy Shift

**Before (v23.x):**
- Stability through structure-lock
- Ring isolation as defense
- Governance as gatekeeping

**After (v24.0):**
- Stability through smallness
- Exit smaller than system
- Governance as conversation

The conversation is the table. The delta is the roll. The human is the resolution.
